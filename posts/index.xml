      <description>Say in a situtation where budget is fixed, what will you do to improve system performance?
 I came out several solutions to this at first, later I came out with more thoughts. I list them here for later reference.
  create selective indexes
  partition tables
  materialized view
  asynchrous processing: put non real-time operations as a job queue, spread jobs to non business hours, non peak loading time etc.</description>

      <description>In stripe doc, Stripe explain how it works as following quoted contet. Other places only mentions that the processes will be only once.
 Stripe&amp;#39;s idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including 500 errors.   Then there is an interesting question how to handle timeout and retry cases?</description>

      <description>I leant API idempotency many years ago when I worked in Asia Fusion Technologies. At that time, I was involved in integration with payment systems and games from different vendor. That gave me a chance to read a lot of API documents and evalute them. During that time, one interesting characteristic of API got my attention. It is API idempotency. That time, there is no much information of idempotency how to implement etc.</description>

    AsciinemaPlayer.create(&#39;/casts/497308.cast&#39;, document.getElementById(&#39;497308&#39;), { });   The cast is about how to use titl for local micro-service development based on kubernetes.

      <description>My first attemp to resolve &amp;#34;Kubernetes Time Check Pod&amp;#34; in https://engineer.kodekloud.com is not successful. The exercise doesn’t allow to open an editor to edit a yaml file. I had to resort to cat. I attempted several times to resolve it on my local cluster, still no luck even I tried different combination such as command, args,string in string, avoiding expansion. This one from stackoverfow gave me a clue how to resolve my issue.</description>

      <description>In the past several days, I practiced several exercises for my coming CKS exam. I noticed that it takes a while to get static pods restart after configuraiton changes. I was curious if there is any faster way to make that happen. I think the following ways definitely will be faster than waiting 3 minutes after I used them for a while. The observable time is shorter than 3 minutes</description>

      <description>I encountered an issue how to get detailed information based on statistics information such as minimum and maximum values in a dataset. The traditional way might be use case expression,coalese functions etc to archive the goals, However I felt it is quite clumsy.
 How do it in a neat way? In SQL standard, there is a way using unpivot to transform columns to rows. It is a good fit for this situation to get a neat SQL statement to resolve the issue.</description>

      <description>I encountered the issue yesterday during my exercise in killer CKA similator. However I made the same mistakes again. I think it worth to write it down to avoid I make the same mistake again.
 In my day to day works, I usually add volumes before containers in the spec section of pods. In exams, sometimes I need to add extra volumes into a existing pod extracted from a running pod, and I still add volumes in the old way.</description>

      <description>Beyond High Availability: The Importance of FMEA in Ensuring Uninterrupted Operations
 Introduction
 In an increasingly interconnected and data-driven world, high availability is a critical component for any system or infrastructure. High availability ensures that a system can continue to operate and deliver its services, even in the face of hardware failures, software glitches, or other unforeseen disruptions. However, high availability alone is not enough to guarantee uninterrupted operations. To achieve true resilience, it’s essential to complement high availability with a proactive approach to risk assessment and mitigation.</description>

      <description>Do you know how to skip first line before data pipe into xargs?
 Today I need to export custom resources and want to avoid error messages because the column names line in the output of kubectl. I knew there is a command line option (--no-headers) of kubectl and managed to get the option, but I don’t want to spend time to search the option in future. Is there any way to skip first line before data pipe into xargs?</description>

      <description>Nowadays, zero downtime is normal, you can’t believe that in azure app service changes in &amp;#34;app settings&amp;#34;, App Service triggers an app restart. The alternative ways to do avoid that is to use sentinel key with App Configuration. however App Configuration will cost a little. Do we really need to use App Configuration to achieve that ?
 The naive and obvious way is that changing appsettings.json files via entering the app services using kudo console.</description>

      <description>Last week I worked on filling info package information to a workbooks. I used VBA macro before and thought of it again to save some of my time.
 Things is changing very fast, the new javascript based custom fuction is the mainstream. The initial one I followed the tutorial, however I didn’t find any way to add it into &amp;#34;My Addin&amp;#34; as described in microsoft doc site. I don’t have administrator rights on my laptop.</description>

      <description>Background I didn’t find a rule implementation of spectral at stoplightio and github to lint the rule that resources should be nouns in REST API. stoplight mentions that Use Nouns for Resource Names, however there is no another article about that. I was bothered by that for a while to the point I want to give it a try to implement my rule for that.
 There are several existing implementations about this rule.</description>

      <description>Background I was once asked how to run big scaled kubernetes clusters regarding etcd size limitation. For example how to handle 8G limitations. I was not satisfied with my answers such as increasing memory, compaction &amp;amp; defragmentation as I knew there were several big scale clusters in several companies and 8GB might be a hard limit. However I didn’t have any clues how they make that happened.
 Since then, I kept tabs on etcd by reading etcd community meeting (Public).</description>

      <description>A typical steps involved in the issuer response process for a card authorization, a simplified description is as following.
  Receive Authorization Request: The card issuer system receives the authorization request from the merchant or payment processor.
  Card Validation: The issuer system validates the card details provided in the request, including the card number, expiration date, and CVV/CVC.
  Account Verification: The issuer system verifies the cardholder’s account details, such as account status, available funds, and credit limit (if applicable).</description>

      <description>I think I am a big fan of textual UML after I learnt it from thoughtworks techradar. I doubted it after my recent experience.
 In the past 2 months I spent long periods of time to think of how to make my Powerpoint slides pass my boss Lim Chee Kiam&amp;#39;s standard. I thought deeply about that. One moment, I asked myself why Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh didn’t come out a diagram which cater to dynamic(behaviour) and static (structure) diagrams, then I realized it will be a mess if those two things are put toghere.</description>

      <description>I chose logseq as my PKM I was overloaded with information in the past several weeks. I sought many ways to overcome it. One choice I made is using logseq as PKM.
   why? There are several open source or freeware verion of PKM. Why did I choose logseq?
   logseq is clojure based. I am a big fan of lisp-liked languages. I studied and did some coding using racket, common-lisp, elisp and clojure after I read Paul Graham’s essays about lisp.</description>

      <description>In my previous two companies, everytime I used the subdomain way without thinking much about this. Recently I wondered the rational behind this decisions. I had the clear answers two days ago. Today I have the time to put it into this writing.

 subdomain(dev.example.com)
 subdomain reasons

      <description>Leader election in Kubernetes control plane - #HeptioProTip give a way how to find out leaders of Kubernetes control plane components kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager. However it was based on a old version of kubernetes, and the mechanism is changed in later versions. Today I was asked how to find the leaders. Here is the new way to find.

I learnt fundamentals of datadog and newrelic, walked through their tutorials in last week and this week. I don’t find a easy way to learn dynatrace from its site. The whole learning experiences between datadog and newrelic are on par with each other. What’s the deal breaker when making choices among them?

      <description>The explanation of pod sandbox at the abstraction that replaces the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; container that is used to keep namespaces open in every Kubernetes pod today. I doubted about that. What’s the point to introduce a new concept? Yerterday I went down the rabbit hole to understand it. This morning I finally got the hang of it.
 Kubernetes blog said it is an environment. It maybe a VM, a group of containers.</description>

      <description>AWS has almost established themselves as the de facto public cloud provider for a lot of businesses, other providers always try to provide similiar services and similar APIs to attract existing AWS customers to migrate to their platform. Each following provider provides similar comparison table comparing to AWS. Those comparison can give one a quick start to adopt their services without major issues. Even those following providers provide migration tools for migrating from aws to their platform.</description>

 My initial journal with gitops was setup my gitops cicd pipeline following the flux tutorial way. I immediately found out the limitation of flux at that time and sought alternative solutions. After comparing different solutions, I settled down argo-cd.
 After a short while usage of argo-cd, I moved configration yamls and kustomization.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I spent one or two hours to resolve a pending order issue. I encountered the issue before when I configured cert-manager with ACME. However after a short while detour to flutter(ios,android) development, I couldn’t quickly locate the root causes. This made me think that it is better off to note down the lessons I leant here.
 DNS01 vs HTTP01 HTTP01 is quite easy to setup for one domain name.</description>

I found that locale changes in device_preview can’t propagate to GetMaterialApp.router.
 I raised a issue, however getx has a bad reputation on fixing issues. I can’t wait so long and I sought other options. Things I tried was to use GetMaterialApp, however always to get several errors.</description>

 multi-cloud deployment When you only use one cloud-provider’s solution to do IaC and things get in your way, you will have hard time to migrate to other providers as you already invested heavily into one provider.</description>

      <description>The real differences is quoted here. You can find the content here
 A kustomization that is marked as a Component has basically the same capabilities as a normal kustomization. The main distinction is that they are evaluated after the resources of the parent kustomization (overlay or component) have been accumulated, and on top of them. This means that: A component with transformers can transform the resources that an overlay has previously specified in the resources field.</description>

In last 2 days, I noticed prometheus-adapter. Today KEDA popped up in my mind. I checked its website and found it can be source of metric as well.
 cAdvisor, Metrics Server, Kubernetes API Server, Node Exporter, and Kube-State-Metrics can be considered as in-cluster source of metric. However KEDA is about out-cluster source of metrics.</description>

      <description>Today I re-read Technology Radar Volume 26, SDUI got my attention. In the past, I was very interested in ERP systems, and studied several open source ERP systems such as openerp(now odoo), ofbiz and adempiere. SDUI is quite similar to technologies used in those open sourced ERP systems.

      <description>It is quite easy to refactor code using IDEs, however it will be a different story considing to refactor to testable code.
 Concerns The refactor functionality in IDE is based on rigor theories and algorithm to make sure the refactors don’t change the behaviours of programs and get it better organized. One of the theories, can be found here

However after serveral practice, I still confused in binary search problems. Latest week an article mentions binary search at https://leetcode.wang/. Little searching, I found more information about this such as lower bound, upper bound, equal-range, open/close range, middle point etc.</description>

      <description>Shift-left is a things nowadays. Recently I read an articles about that beyond testing and security. Today I gave it a try using datree and found that there are still a lot of places to improve in one of my clusters. It is not just a small number. There maybe are many new concepts, configurations and best practicies behind the numbers.

      <description>Today I had a case to expose serveral kubernetes dashboard with cert-manager. Initiallly I thought it should be quite easy to setup, but the reality was quite different. My intial yaml is as following.
 apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: ingress-global-dash namespace: kubernetes-dashboard labels: name: ingress-global-dash use-http01-solver: &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; annotations: cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: &amp;#34;test-issuer&amp;#34; spec: ingressClassName: nginx rules: - host: &amp;#34;dashboard.example.com&amp;#34; http: paths: - pathType: Prefix path: &amp;#34;/&amp;#34; backend: service: name: kubernetes-dashboard port: number: 80 #later changed to 443 according to port of kubernetes-dashboard svc tls: # &amp;lt; placing a host in the TLS config will determine what ends up in the cert&amp;#39;s subjectAltNames - hosts: - dashboard.</description>

However you couldn’t get the correct local time in dotnet 6.0. I found the issue About time incorrect of docker image about aspnet-6 #62545.

Nginx is more than reverse proxy or webservers which I thought initially after several months of extensive usage in the past. Here I list serveral advanced use case I countered or discussed with other experts.

      <description>I only noticed the steps after one ergent cancelling of creating. I didn’t find corresponding nodes and wondered what happened. I deleted my cluster and recreated one.
 I knew I can create nodegroup after creating cluster and not sure if I can do those sub tasks this way as well. Leave it here for later investigation.
 2 sequential tasks: { create cluster control plane &amp;#34;uat-local-intl&amp;#34;, 2 sequential sub-tasks: { 4 sequential sub-tasks: { wait for control plane to become ready, associate IAM OIDC provider, 4 parallel sub-tasks: { 2 sequential sub-tasks: { create IAM role for serviceaccount &amp;#34;backend-apps/s3-reader&amp;#34;, create serviceaccount &amp;#34;backend-apps/s3-reader&amp;#34;, }, 2 sequential sub-tasks: { create IAM role for serviceaccount &amp;#34;backend-apps/cache-access&amp;#34;, create serviceaccount &amp;#34;backend-apps/cache-access&amp;#34;, }, 2 sequential sub-tasks: { create IAM role for serviceaccount &amp;#34;kube-system/cluster-autoscaler&amp;#34;, create serviceaccount &amp;#34;kube-system/cluster-autoscaler&amp;#34;, }, 2 sequential sub-tasks: { create IAM role for serviceaccount &amp;#34;kube-system/aws-node&amp;#34;, create serviceaccount &amp;#34;kube-system/aws-node&amp;#34;, }, }, restart daemonset &amp;#34;kube-system/aws-node&amp;#34;, }, create nodegroup &amp;#34;ng-1&amp;#34;, } }   </description>

      <description>In the past I knew jsonnet, however I didn’t commit too much time to learn it until recently I encountered a data driven scenario, generating istio yaml configurations based on an array of data. The scenario is business driven, and I can foresee that there will be more data coming. What a waste of time to repeat the copy/paste procedures with little tweaks. I hated to do that again and again.</description>

      <description>I started one of my certificates using cert-manager and letsencrypt without root domain in one product system. Later I tried to add root domain to the certificate as our customer requested withou success at first day. I figured out how to do that next morning. Here are my the success one and several failed attempts.
 Here some background information of this system: gitops + argocd
 Successful solution Considering that the app argocd is in manual synchronization mode, I can do that changes in place in kubernetes instead of the git repo.</description>

      <description>TLDR: my CICD choice: argo-cd and argo-workflow
Since I chose argocd and github action as our CICD pipeline two years ago, I rarely thought about other choices and the reason I made the choices. Recently I leant from several sources that jenkins is still widely used, it arouse my interest on this subject again. I reconsidered my choice and layed out the reasons here for my future references.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good impression with java in my past java projects.</description>

      <description>Since my first time to configure istio with proxy protocol supports in aws, istio and envoyproxy changed a lot. In the past several days, I was exposed to a different scenario that one service to expose into multiple domains.
 Things are getting not straighforward, I struggled to make it success yesterday. Today another layer of complexity was added into my cluster: an extra ingressgateway for some services.
 For multiple ingress gateways, I followed this article, however my setup is more complex than that.</description>

      <description>Here is an issue with aws-ebs-csi-driver: The size of file system doesn’t change when pvc is expanded. I got the same issue when I tried to do the Curl elk in pods to delete indices this afternoon. I got the message &amp;#34;resize2fs 1.44.5 (15-Dec-2018) open: No such file or directory while opening /dev/nvme1n1&amp;#34; as well when I tried to resize the file system /dev/nvme1n1 in my pod.
 As the issue is about csidriver, it is not in the the result of running command &amp;#34;kubectl get csidriver&amp;#34; on my cluster.</description>

      <description>Today my staging kibana didn’t show logs. I made the decision to work out a solution to solve issue in hard way this time. I don’t want me in the same situation without solutoins.
 When things go wrong, you can’t login kibana to do management or maintainance works. The left option is managing the data from the command line. In the past I figured out to use curl cli in pod to get some information of elk.</description>

      <description>I did resize volume of kubernetes in the past, however I encountered an interesting issue when I did the resizing in different way.
 According to doc, I should only change the requested size in pvc. Today I changed the size of pv first, then pvc. Here was the interesting thing: all things of pv and pvc are fine, but the size of the file system in pod was not changed.</description>

I didn’t see the increase of nodes several minutes after I run the eksctl scale command.

      <description>I wrote this on September 7, 2021 and published it on linkedin. However I found that it can be hard to search if I put there. so I put here anoter copy
 TLDR: if your external SMTP is using port 80 instead of standard ports in an istio mesh, create a Service Entry for the external SMTP.
 These two days, a strange timeout issue happened in one of our kubernetes clusters when trying to send emails via SMTP even though the same configuration works perfectly on our development machines.</description>

      <description>Summary: use digest as the way to refer to docker images in kubernetes resources, put commit id in image labels.
 An idempotency and immutable infrastructure has a slew of benefits. I am a firm believer of it and I did my best to keep several projects in that way. In the past few weeks, I helped one friend to resolve system structure, performance issue and development experience of one of his projects.</description>

   secret
  downwardAPI
  configMap
  serviceAccountToken
   I made the small tweak to hello world sample workflow. Here is the my demo workflow with projected volumes.</description>

      <description>Since I read the textual UML in the 2015 techradar, I am a big fan of it. I used plantuml in my technical writing in Asia Fusion Technology. Later I found asciidoc, and I wanted to combine the two together. I regularly read techradar from thoughtworks and found mermaidjs in NOV 2018 techradar. However it was little hard to integrate that into my site at that time. Today I knew Hugo supports Mermaid Diagrams easily.</description>

   Multi-platform I started to look into one iOS and android app of our projects one week ago, and started to use Mac Air M1. Mac Air M1 is arm64 based, however our production environment is amd64 based. I had to do some changes to make the images built on my or my colleagues&amp;#39; machine can be runnable in production environment.</description>

I sought to other options and find https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428 and https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/mounting-kubernetes-secret-single-file-inside-pod.
 The comment https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428#issuecomment-775911838 gives an example to add user name and password into https url. Upon I checked the logs, I found that user and password are shown in the logs of a workflow.</description>

      <description>Today I found my argo-events sensor executed triggers which I was not intended to. In the logs, I found that ref fields of those non-intended triggers all started with &amp;#34;refs/heads/dev&amp;#34;. I checked again with document and found this surprising truth:
 https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/sensors/filters/data/#:~:text=If%20data%20type%20is%20string%2C%20you%20can%20pass%20either%20an%20exact%20value%20or%20a%20regex.%20In%20any%20case%20that%20value%20will%20be%20evaluated%20as%20a%20regex.
 If data type is string, you can pass either an exact value or a regex. In any case that value will be evaluated as a regex.   Considing my following data filter, no wonder it triggers more than I expected.</description>

      <description>Webhook of argo-events supports authentication, however the field is fixed in header. If your callers don’t do that way, you are screwed. Recently days, I was trying to integrate gitee with argo-workflow and argo-events. I hit the wall here.

 There were many reasons which stopped me in the past to writing. One was that my vocabulary was limited. I started my blogging actitivies back to 2004. At that time, my vocabulary was limited, I think the size of my vocabulary was in the range from 6000-7000 and most words were memorized in isolated way.</description>

After two or three weeks since the project kicked off, I had a thought why not move to Hugo considering several benefits.
 For the uninitiated, Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.</description>

There is no errors in logs of pods and the node, events of kubernete. All seems normal. I created a simple nginx pod with nodeName as the problematic node. The pod can be scheduled and created in the node. However the pod was kept in CrashloopBackOff state. There is definitely something wrong with server.</description>

   Prologue Before I was interested in bazel, I always thought why bother to learn a new building system even I knew that kubernetes once was built with bazel. 4 months ago, I was involved in a micro service structured project. I was dissatisfied with dev workflow using skaffold and I looked other options in the market.</description>

      <description>Last week I setup our staging kubernetes environment, however the once worked version of runnerset yaml configuration didn’t work. I tried different combination of controller and summerwind/actions-runner-dind image, fully customized template portion with RUNNER_xxx arguments. I still got &amp;#34;Http response code: NotFound from &amp;#39;POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration&amp;#39;&amp;#34; for every combination of those combinations in the logs of runner pods. I thought RunnerDeployment is stateless and less complex than RunnerSet. I gave it a try.</description>

      <description>TLDR: if your external SMTP is using port 80 instead of standard ports in an istio mesh, create a Service Entry for the external SMTP.
 These two days, a strange timeout issue happened in one of our kubernetes clusters when trying to send emails via SMTP even though the same configuration works perfectly on our development machines.
 At first, I thought it was due to SecureSocketOptions.startTLS. I changed it to SecureSocketOptions.</description>

      <description>Two days ago, our web applications need to get clients&amp;#39; real IP address. Our sites is hosted in kubernetes, isito is used for ingress controll. behind cloud load balancers, it is not easy to make it work.
 There are two ways to do that in alibaba classic load balancer: http/https listeners, and TCP listeners with proxy protocol
 HTTPS listeners is crossed out due to certificate issue. HTTPS listeners can use integrated certificates or self uploaded certificates.</description>

      <description>Secrets Management is the strong suit of Hashicorp vault. Open source edition is little limited comparing to cloud and enterprise edition, and cloud and enterprise editions sometimes are not allowed due to some reasons. bank-vaults seems a promising solution based on open source edition of Hashicorp Vault.
 Advanced usage of vault will involve HSM and SoftHSM is good start point without spending several hundards bucks. Besides, HSM is widely used in Financial sector, blockchain and cryptocurrency.</description>

      <description>2 weeks I started to learn alicloud to prepare the migration from aws to alicloud. I started the migration this week. Our applications are deployed on kubernetes, I focused on ACK first. The setup journey was bumpy, and most of the issues can be resolved by googling and trial loops. The most difficult one is that dns resolution issue.
 I tried the steps in &amp;#34;Debugging DNS Resolution&amp;#34; [1]. All steps were good except the nslookup step.</description>

I tried nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex:true and nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1. To avoid to block others to others to use staging environment, I setup an skaffold local development environment to troubeshooting the issue. I tried following annotation as well.

      <description>During practicing the lifecycle handlers of pod, I found it is quite difficult to get the logs logged from preStop handlers. Initially I thought terminationMessagePath maybe is the answer, but no such luck. The preStop handler will be run before the pod is deleted. After deleted, there is no way to get the logs unless those logs are kept in other place such as central log servers etc. Those settings are way complex for a simple practice and time-consuming.</description>

 I read several articles before I tried the aboved one. The successful debug after several trial and errors. I added skaffold.yaml to the project and installed Cloud Code. skaffold.yaml can be found at https://github.com/jackliusr/dockerdev/tree/kubernetes-debug.

Steps from internets are all about describe, logs, liveProbe etc. I noticed the reason and exit code in last state when I described one of the pod. It should be the focus point to find root cause of CrashBoopBackOff.

      <description>I encountered the same issue &amp;#34;File error: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, bind-map&amp;#34; twice in my setup of spacemacs. The issue can be solved several ways which I found from github and clojurians-log.clojureverse.org. I consolidate the reasons and list them below.
   Timeout: the relevant setting in .spacemacs :- dotspacemacs-elpa-timeout 30

      <description>Chemical Bonding The Stable Electronic configuration of a noble gas An outer electron or outermost electron is also known as valence electron. Only outer electrons are involved in chemical reactions.
 In what way do noble gases behave differently from other chemistry ? Noble gases are unreactive because they have fully filled outer shells, that is, they have duplet or octet electronic configuration.
 How do atom achieve the electronic configuration of a noble gas?</description>

      <description>Inside Atoms All matter is made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons and electrons.
 The protons and neutrons
   are tightly packed in the centre of an atom
  together from the nucleus of the atom.
   The electrons move rapidly around the nucleus.

      <description>I was not familiar with SIP states during the integration of VoIP products such as twilio, plivo and sinch. I am still confused about the state changes after reading documents. Here try to visualize the state change and help me to remember it. The state chart is based on my understanding. It is not necessarily correct. It is just for my reference.

      <description>Asynchronization is very hard. It brings benefits with several catches for backend programming. Here is serveral catches and respective solutions. However all those will increase the cost of developments.
   Hard to debug and trace As the process breaks down to serveral asynchronious subprocesses, it is very difficult to relate all information of the process when something goes wrong. An extra overhead correlation Id is needed to adopt to ameliorate this issue.</description>

      <description>I read a lot of blogs. However I rarely wrote my blogs about my thoughts and learning experiences as I thought those are lack of originality.
 I changed my mind after I learned more than ten thousand words using anki and memrise in the past 2 years. A writing can serve multiple purposes even lack of originality and thorough thought. Here is a list of those purposes:
