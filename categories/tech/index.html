 TLDR: if your external SMTP is using port 80 instead of standard ports in an istio mesh, create a Service Entry for the external SMTP.
 These two days, a strange timeout issue happened in one of our kubernetes clusters when trying to send emails via SMTP even though the same configuration works perfectly on our development machines.

      Summary: use digest as the way to refer to docker images in kubernetes resources, put commit id in image labels.
 An idempotency and immutable infrastructure has a slew of benefits. I am a firm believer of it and I did my best to keep several projects in that way. In the past few weeks, I helped one friend to resolve system structure, performance issue and development experience of one of his projects.

   Multi-platform I started to look into one iOS and android app of our projects one week ago, and started to use Mac Air M1. Mac Air M1 is arm64 based, however our production environment is amd64 based. I had to do some changes to make the images built on my or my colleagues&#39; machine can be runnable in production environment.

I sought to other options and find https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428 and https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/mounting-kubernetes-secret-single-file-inside-pod.
 The comment https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428#issuecomment-775911838 gives an example to add user name and password into https url. Upon I checked the logs, I found that user and password are shown in the logs of a workflow.

 If data type is string, you can pass either an exact value or a regex. In any case that value will be evaluated as a regex.   Considing my following data filter, no wonder it triggers more than I expected.

      Two days ago, I have a fun journey to find more about rich link preview features in social media, web apps and IM apps.
 The journey began with that the shared link of one of my company sites in skype was shown without pictures, just a plain link. Searching the feature of skype &#34;link preview&#34;, I found https://socialsharepreview.com/. I knew what missed in the homepage as in the following list.

      Usually I don’t want to blog about something, espicially I don’t contribute some original things to internet. Of couse, there are other reasons as well.
 There were many reasons which stopped me in the past to writing. One was that my vocabulary was limited. I started my blogging actitivies back to 2004. At that time, my vocabulary was limited, I think the size of my vocabulary was in the range from 6000-7000 and most words were memorized in isolated way.

      I wrote my blogs using Jekyll at this domain almost two years occasionally from 2018 until 2020. I didn’t think to move to Hugo before it was used in one of my company project. After two or three weeks since the project kicked off, I had a thought why not move to Hugo considering several benefits.
 For the uninitiated, Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.

      Today I encountered a strange issue with one kubernete cluster. Newly created pods are not created on a newly joined node. There is no errors in logs of pods and the node, events of kubernete. All seems normal. I created a simple nginx pod with nodeName as the problematic node. The pod can be scheduled and created in the node. However the pod was kept in CrashloopBackOff state. There is definitely something wrong with server.

 I followed the instruction to install dapr vs code extension in dapr. My environment is WSL based. I tried several times to try to debug the dapr applications and failed. I noticed in the following screenshot that there was a warning icon before kubernetes.

      TLDR: Bazel is definitely worth to use on your projects even though it has minimum supports of some languages such as C#.
   Prologue Before I was interested in bazel, I always thought why bother to learn a new building system even I knew that kubernetes once was built with bazel. 4 months ago, I was involved in a micro service structured project. I was dissatisfied with dev workflow using skaffold and I looked other options in the market.

      Last week I setup our staging kubernetes environment, however the once worked version of runnerset yaml configuration didn’t work. I tried different combination of controller and summerwind/actions-runner-dind image, fully customized template portion with RUNNER_xxx arguments. I still got &#34;Http response code: NotFound from &#39;POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration&#39;&#34; for every combination of those combinations in the logs of runner pods. I thought RunnerDeployment is stateless and less complex than RunnerSet. I gave it a try.

      Two days ago, our web applications need to get clients&#39; real IP address. Our sites is hosted in kubernetes, isito is used for ingress controll. behind cloud load balancers, it is not easy to make it work.
 There are two ways to do that in alibaba classic load balancer: http/https listeners, and TCP listeners with proxy protocol
 HTTPS listeners is crossed out due to certificate issue. HTTPS listeners can use integrated certificates or self uploaded certificates.

      During practicing the lifecycle handlers of pod, I found it is quite difficult to get the logs logged from preStop handlers. Initially I thought terminationMessagePath maybe is the answer, but no such luck. The preStop handler will be run before the pod is deleted. After deleted, there is no way to get the logs unless those logs are kept in other place such as central log servers etc. Those settings are way complex for a simple practice and time-consuming.

      I loved to read novels. Recently I found that several sites show some garbed characters in square boxes. I went to the original site qidian and those chacters are shown correctly in the orignal site. After little investigation, I found the following information;
          In above pics, 了’s HTML entity code is , it is not as 天.
 How does chrome show the characters correctly?

      Today one of my deployments always got CrashLoopBackOff. Searching internet don’t gave me the root cause of those errors even I went through all the steps. Steps from internets are all about describe, logs, liveProbe etc. I noticed the reason and exit code in last state when I described one of the pod. It should be the focus point to find root cause of CrashBoopBackOff.

      I am a big fan of Tex and asciidoc. Asciidoctor is ruby based and can been easily integrated into jekyll. Hugo currently still has some rough edges in asciidoc integration. Considering the time and effort to switch to Hugo, it is not worth to do that.

 I run into module not found issues when I try to run those examples under the repository of redus-saga. Even following comments in github issues and stackoverflow, those solutions don’t work out.
 Scripts in the package.json of the root folder don’t work for examples.
 After run yarn &amp;&amp; yarn build, can change directories to those examples and run them.

      I was not familiar with SIP states during the integration of VoIP products such as twilio, plivo and sinch. I am still confused about the state changes after reading documents. Here try to visualize the state change and help me to remember it. The state chart is based on my understanding. It is not necessarily correct. It is just for my reference.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Asynchronization is very hard. It brings benefits with several catches for backend programming. Here is serveral catches and respective solutions. However all those will increase the cost of developments.
   Hard to debug and trace As the process breaks down to serveral asynchronious subprocesses, it is very difficult to relate all information of the process when something goes wrong. An extra overhead correlation Id is needed to adopt to ameliorate this issue.

      Today my staging kibana didn’t show logs. I made the decision to work out a solution to solve issue in hard way this time. I don’t want me in the same situation without solutoins.
 When things go wrong, you can’t login kibana to do management or maintainance works. The left option is managing the data from the command line. In the past I figured out to use curl cli in pod to get some information of elk.
