Is it true for FHIR, especially firely sdk? I answered so in a discussion, however I doubted it as I didn’t do it in FHIR. Here I have a short code to demostrate the two case.

      Most information about custom task of msbuild are quite basic, it will get complicated when it is involved reflection. I tried several ways according searching results and answers from chatgpt: reflection, assemblyLoadContext and mono cecil. The most promising one is mono.cecil.
 I tried directly loading assemblies and via AssemblyLoadContext. They all failed to load some microsoft assemblies. It looks awkward even I can change my build scripts to copy those assemblies.

      How do you extract multiple fields at different levels of nesting json resources? jsonpath, jq, jmespath or chatgpt?
 In FHIR, bundle resource in json format usually have multiple level of details nested in json. It’s quite different from other use cases.
 My first thought is using jsonpath as it is quite similar to FHIRPath. There are several limitations of jsonpath which make it infeasible.
  It doesn’t support to the use case, even though JsonPath supports deep scan and Bracket-notated child or children.

 In the old post, one can quickly spot that the package information is fetched twice. It is the place to optimize today. I will put selected fields into a column, and extract values from the column later. This way, It can spend less time.

 I came out several solutions to this at first, later I came out with more thoughts. I list them here for later reference.
  create selective indexes
  partition tables
  materialized view
  asynchrous processing: put non real-time operations as a job queue, spread jobs to non business hours, non peak loading time etc.

      In stripe doc, Stripe explain how it works as following quoted contet. Other places only mentions that the processes will be only once.
 Stripe&#39;s idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including 500 errors.   Then there is an interesting question how to handle timeout and retry cases?

 How do it in a neat way? In SQL standard, there is a way using unpivot to transform columns to rows. It is a good fit for this situation to get a neat SQL statement to resolve the issue.

      Beyond High Availability: The Importance of FMEA in Ensuring Uninterrupted Operations
 Introduction
 In an increasingly interconnected and data-driven world, high availability is a critical component for any system or infrastructure. High availability ensures that a system can continue to operate and deliver its services, even in the face of hardware failures, software glitches, or other unforeseen disruptions. However, high availability alone is not enough to guarantee uninterrupted operations. To achieve true resilience, it’s essential to complement high availability with a proactive approach to risk assessment and mitigation.

      Nowadays, zero downtime is normal, you can’t believe that in azure app service changes in &#34;app settings&#34;, App Service triggers an app restart. The alternative ways to do avoid that is to use sentinel key with App Configuration. however App Configuration will cost a little. Do we really need to use App Configuration to achieve that ?
 The naive and obvious way is that changing appsettings.json files via entering the app services using kudo console.

Each following provider provides similar comparison table comparing to AWS. Those comparison can give one a quick start to adopt their services without major issues.

I found that locale changes in device_preview can’t propagate to GetMaterialApp.router.
 I raised a issue, however getx has a bad reputation on fixing issues. I can’t wait so long and I sought other options. Things I tried was to use GetMaterialApp, however always to get several errors.

 multi-cloud deployment When you only use one cloud-provider’s solution to do IaC and things get in your way, you will have hard time to migrate to other providers as you already invested heavily into one provider.

      In the past two days, I always got the errors &#34;packages cannot be resolved&#34; in eclipse with gradle projects. Initial I encountered the issue, I desperately wanted to resolved the issue. I tried several ways to do that by using solutions from web, however I didn’t get my issue resolved. Due to time constraint, I went back to the old mvn way to do the project. Today I have sometime to revisit the issue now.

      The real differences is quoted here. You can find the content here
 A kustomization that is marked as a Component has basically the same capabilities as a normal kustomization. The main distinction is that they are evaluated after the resources of the parent kustomization (overlay or component) have been accumulated, and on top of them. This means that: A component with transformers can transform the resources that an overlay has previously specified in the resources field.

Nginx is more than reverse proxy or webservers which I thought initially after several months of extensive usage in the past. Here I list serveral advanced use case I countered or discussed with other experts.

 Things are getting not straighforward, I struggled to make it success yesterday. Today another layer of complexity was added into my cluster: an extra ingressgateway for some services.
 For multiple ingress gateways, I followed this article, however my setup is more complex than that.

 TLDR: if your external SMTP is using port 80 instead of standard ports in an istio mesh, create a Service Entry for the external SMTP.
 These two days, a strange timeout issue happened in one of our kubernetes clusters when trying to send emails via SMTP even though the same configuration works perfectly on our development machines.

      Since I read the textual UML in the 2015 techradar, I am a big fan of it. I used plantuml in my technical writing in Asia Fusion Technology. Later I found asciidoc, and I wanted to combine the two together. I regularly read techradar from thoughtworks and found mermaidjs in NOV 2018 techradar. However it was little hard to integrate that into my site at that time. Today I knew Hugo supports Mermaid Diagrams easily.

   Multi-platform I started to look into one iOS and android app of our projects one week ago, and started to use Mac Air M1. Mac Air M1 is arm64 based, however our production environment is amd64 based. I had to do some changes to make the images built on my or my colleagues&#39; machine can be runnable in production environment.

At that time, my vocabulary was limited, I think the size of my vocabulary was in the range from 6000-7000 and most words were memorized in isolated way.

 For the uninitiated, Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.

 These two days, a strange timeout issue happened in one of our kubernetes clusters when trying to send emails via SMTP even though the same configuration works perfectly on our development machines.

      Secrets Management is the strong suit of Hashicorp vault. Open source edition is little limited comparing to cloud and enterprise edition, and cloud and enterprise editions sometimes are not allowed due to some reasons. bank-vaults seems a promising solution based on open source edition of Hashicorp Vault.
 Advanced usage of vault will involve HSM and SoftHSM is good start point without spending several hundards bucks. Besides, HSM is widely used in Financial sector, blockchain and cryptocurrency.

      2 weeks I started to learn alicloud to prepare the migration from aws to alicloud. I started the migration this week. Our applications are deployed on kubernetes, I focused on ACK first. The setup journey was bumpy, and most of the issues can be resolved by googling and trial loops. The most difficult one is that dns resolution issue.
 I tried the steps in &#34;Debugging DNS Resolution&#34; [1]. All steps were good except the nslookup step.

      Several months ago, I resolved the issue &#34;404 Error on refresh with SPA&#34; by using nginx try_files directive, this time it was quite different as the apps were deployed into kubernetes. I tried nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex:true and nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1. To avoid to block others to others to use staging environment, I setup an skaffold local development environment to troubeshooting the issue. I tried following annotation as well.

      During practicing the lifecycle handlers of pod, I found it is quite difficult to get the logs logged from preStop handlers. Initially I thought terminationMessagePath maybe is the answer, but no such luck. The preStop handler will be run before the pod is deleted. After deleted, there is no way to get the logs unless those logs are kept in other place such as central log servers etc. Those settings are way complex for a simple practice and time-consuming.

   Hard to debug and trace As the process breaks down to serveral asynchronious subprocesses, it is very difficult to relate all information of the process when something goes wrong. An extra overhead correlation Id is needed to adopt to ameliorate this issue.

      I always thought SaaS are based shardig, load balance and multiple-tenant. In the past several days, I re-read Dynamo and DynamoDB papers to figure out some key info to share with my colleages to find a common ground about DynamoDB. One thing is mentioned many times in DynamoDB is token-bucket. Suddenly a thought popped out my mind when I walked back after lunch with my colleague that token-bucket algorithm should be a component of SaaS and multiple-tenant.

      When I was preparing a slides to recommend broad usage of JsonSchema, somethings I thought are good to have for general public usage. Those things troubled me for a while during I authored a JsonSchema.
 Versioning Currently there is no standard way how to define a version for a schema. I might use a version property for that. SemVer is good fit for the version content schema. Use if and else for different version.
