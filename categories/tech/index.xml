      <description>Since wrote Things learnt from recent preparation of 1T data for testing, I had figured out how to do that on the following weekends. Today I couldn’t get the steps to do so immediately. It is better to note down for my next time usage. The detailed steps is as following
  Find the location in the file
  Get the block contains contents to modify
  Extract the block to a file and modify it</description>

      <description>Several things learnt from recent preparation of data for testing.
 Question the way when it takes too long to process data sed: remove last n lines In the past I always thought sed is the fastest way to manipulate data. Is it true for all the cases? I generated 1T testing data in ndjson format, however the last lines of those files are corrupted json data. I had to remove the last line.</description>

      <description>One thing constantly bothered me since I used mermaid for flowchart, how to correctly group elements in a group. Only today I have a thought about what will happen if I put node in subgraph without links between them. Finally I got it works to correctly group elements in a group.
Another things, mermaid diagram is natively supported in asciidoctor now. This one is my first example to use it.</description>

      <description>In Beating the average, Paul Graham mentioned lisp is the secret weapon behind his startups, he also elaborated on that point. I believed deeply that after I wrote some small programmings in common lisp before I learnt reddit pilot from lisp to python. Since then I always doubt if the power of lisp is still relevant considering that java, dotnet, python and ruby ecosystems are more mature than that time.</description>

      <description>Due to security policy, I had to set dotnet_cli_home to non-default location to run some building steps. Things went quite well until not. All my command line usages and batch scripts work, until I tried to create a project using the custom project template via Visual Studio and noticed that old deleted template was shown in &amp;#34;Create a new project&amp;#34; dialog.
 I tried several options and none of them works for my case.</description>

      <description>Most time, I think json is forward and backward compatible as long as some convention is kept such as adding fields only etc. I always thought so since I studied CQRS and event sourcing. Is it true for FHIR, especially firely sdk? I answered so in a discussion, however I doubted it as I didn’t do it in FHIR. Here I have a short code to demostrate the two case. In the end, the result is yes and no.</description>

      <description>Due to the nature that it is difficult to debug msbuild custom task, I thought if I can use it in a way to streamline my debug workflow. one pack command will complete the following steps. - pack - add the package into local feed source - add the package to global-packages folder
 My current workflow is below. It is a manual process. It is realy a pain this way: - pack - nuget add [package-name] -source C:\nexus\.</description>

      <description>Most information about custom task of msbuild are quite basic, it will get complicated when it is involved reflection. I tried several ways according searching results and answers from chatgpt: reflection, assemblyLoadContext and mono cecil. The most promising one is mono.cecil.
 I tried directly loading assemblies and via AssemblyLoadContext. They all failed to load some microsoft assemblies. It looks awkward even I can change my build scripts to copy those assemblies.</description>

      <description>I shared one of CICD I designed and implemented in linkedin. It is good to keep here as well. I researched several options and put my thought at Reflection on implementation of CICD using argo-workflows
   Nowadays, argo-workflows is quite mature. I will use argo-workflows for CI part in my future projects. It is definitely worth to invest one’s time on argo-workflow as it is widely used.

      <description>What will you do when you encountered a runtime version is disallowed for specific version say 8.0.6 in building environment? Install the specific runtime version, right? Please hold, I show you my story.
 I initially thought I couldn’t run the below commands to install it, it is not. After several attempts, My colleague spotted the difference between runtime version and sdk version. They are different. A runtime version is supported by several sdk versions.</description>

      <description>Just an architecture style MACH got me attention. It is short for micro service based, API first, cloud native, headless. There are two of projects I involved one are in this architecture style. One is sitecore based, another one is developed. Kubernetes, nodejs, npm, strapi tsoa are used. Their mapping is as following.
   micro services based: multiple services based on expressjs
  api first: tsao
  cloud native: more advanced than cloud native, kubernate native is used.</description>

      <description>In the past several months, I called it quite intensive. I need to master the knowledge of FHIR, advanced dotnet technologies (attributes, generator, reflection, code emit, expression tree, advanced linq, customized aspnet pipeline, nuget package), code optimization technologies and several aws technologies (DynamoDB, S3, glue, spark) in depth to meet the schedule of a project. You really can’t account on solution architects or support engineers from cloud providers. I don’t get one perfect answers from them so far when I used their services.</description>

      <description>It is about three months now. I make reflections on things I have done well and bad. I will refine my learning workflow.
 In the past, I used 2nd-brain, daily-logging, flashcard and spaced-repetition systems to help to accelerate my learning under the circumstance that I can’t get fully complete information from different stake holders. I was left with only way to find it out by myself. I read all material I thought will be useful and noted them down in my logseq vault.</description>

      <description>I am passionate about technological details and how things work under the hood. Recently I didn’t get confirmative answers from AWS. I spent a half day to re-read the famous paper. and the new one Amazon DynamoDB: A Scalable, Predictably Performant, and Fully Managed NoSQL Database Service. I think the following several concepts can be helpful to under its predictable performance.

I thought I was quite good at jsonschema. I dont’k think so after recent usage of jsonschema for a very aspnet flexible configuration file.
 Configurations in dotnet are quite straight forwards if all the configurations following the Options pattern. ConfigurationProcessor is not that case.</description>

      Nowadays, copilot almost is everywhere, office suite, vscode, visual studio, windows and edge browser. Never thought it is embedded in browse web console.</description>

      <description>Prologue One or two years ago, I tried several times to install kind cluster to using cilium cni. However I didn’t make it. Today I really want to setup one after reading an Kind cluster with Cilium and no kube-proxy and considering that major kubernetes distributions are using cilium cni now. After about 3 hours, I finally got it running successfully. Things don’t go smoothly. Here are my steps to setup it up.</description>

      <description>I used .netrc in several projects and I wrote something about that. I thought it is a convenient way for git until recently.
 Recently I have a new laptop and want to setup my git credentials. This time, I noticed .netrc might not be secure as other applications that use cURL to make requests to servers defined in your .netrc file will also now be authenticated using these credentials.</description>

      <description>How do you extract multiple fields at different levels of nesting json resources? jsonpath, jq, jmespath or chatgpt?
 In FHIR, bundle resource in json format usually have multiple level of details nested in json. It’s quite different from other use cases.
 My first thought is using jsonpath as it is quite similar to FHIRPath. There are several limitations of jsonpath which make it infeasible.
  It doesn’t support to the use case, even though JsonPath supports deep scan and Bracket-notated child or children.</description>

 In the old post, one can quickly spot that the package information is fetched twice. It is the place to optimize today. I will put selected fields into a column, and extract values from the column later. This way, It can spend less time.</description>

  asynchrous processing: put non real-time operations as a job queue, spread jobs to non business hours, non peak loading time etc.</description>

 Stripe&amp;#39;s idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including 500 errors.   Then there is an interesting question how to handle timeout and retry cases?</description>

 How do it in a neat way? In SQL standard, there is a way using unpivot to transform columns to rows. It is a good fit for this situation to get a neat SQL statement to resolve the issue.</description>

      <description>Beyond High Availability: The Importance of FMEA in Ensuring Uninterrupted Operations
 Introduction
 In an increasingly interconnected and data-driven world, high availability is a critical component for any system or infrastructure. High availability ensures that a system can continue to operate and deliver its services, even in the face of hardware failures, software glitches, or other unforeseen disruptions. However, high availability alone is not enough to guarantee uninterrupted operations. To achieve true resilience, it’s essential to complement high availability with a proactive approach to risk assessment and mitigation.</description>

      <description>Do you know how to skip first line before data pipe into xargs?
 Today I need to export custom resources and want to avoid error messages because the column names line in the output of kubectl. I knew there is a command line option (--no-headers) of kubectl and managed to get the option, but I don’t want to spend time to search the option in future. Is there any way to skip first line before data pipe into xargs?</description>

      <description>Nowadays, zero downtime is normal, you can’t believe that in azure app service changes in &amp;#34;app settings&amp;#34;, App Service triggers an app restart. The alternative ways to do avoid that is to use sentinel key with App Configuration. however App Configuration will cost a little. Do we really need to use App Configuration to achieve that ?
 The naive and obvious way is that changing appsettings.json files via entering the app services using kudo console.</description>

 Things is changing very fast, the new javascript based custom fuction is the mainstream. The initial one I followed the tutorial, however I didn’t find any way to add it into &amp;#34;My Addin&amp;#34; as described in microsoft doc site.

I was bothered by that for a while to the point I want to give it a try to implement my rule for that.
 There are several existing implementations about this rule.</description>

      <description>Background I was once asked how to run big scaled kubernetes clusters regarding etcd size limitation. For example how to handle 8G limitations. I was not satisfied with my answers such as increasing memory, compaction &amp;amp; defragmentation as I knew there were several big scale clusters in several companies and 8GB might be a hard limit. However I didn’t have any clues how they make that happened.
 Since then, I kept tabs on etcd by reading etcd community meeting (Public).</description>

  Receive Authorization Request: The card issuer system receives the authorization request from the merchant or payment processor.
  Card Validation: The issuer system validates the card details provided in the request, including the card number, expiration date, and CVV/CVC.
  Account Verification: The issuer system verifies the cardholder’s account details, such as account status, available funds, and credit limit (if applicable).</description>

      <description>I think I am a big fan of textual UML after I learnt it from thoughtworks techradar. I doubted it after my recent experience.
 In the past 2 months I spent long periods of time to think of how to make my Powerpoint slides pass my boss Lim Chee Kiam&amp;#39;s standard. I thought deeply about that. One moment, I asked myself why Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh didn’t come out a diagram which cater to dynamic(behaviour) and static (structure) diagrams, then I realized it will be a mess if those two things are put toghere.</description>

   why? There are several open source or freeware verion of PKM. Why did I choose logseq?
   logseq is clojure based. I am a big fan of lisp-liked languages. I studied and did some coding using racket, common-lisp, elisp and clojure after I read Paul Graham’s essays about lisp.</description>

The whole learning experiences between datadog and newrelic are on par with each other. What’s the deal breaker when making choices among them?

   Metrics Server
 Metrics Server collects resource metrics from Kubelets and exposes them in Kubernetes apiserver through Metrics API for use by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler. Metrics API can also be accessed by kubectl top, making it easier to debug autoscaling pipelines.
 Metrics Server is not meant for non-autoscaling purposes

      <description>Usually I tell others that I have about 5 years experience of aws services. Today I want to know more about how many years experience I have. I logged in my aws account and tried to find my account creation date. There is no such information in account page. I was so eager to find the information and searched for alternative way to get that information. The easiest way is good one, however I already deleted the email.</description>

      <description>AWS has almost established themselves as the de facto public cloud provider for a lot of businesses, other providers always try to provide similiar services and similar APIs to attract existing AWS customers to migrate to their platform. Each following provider provides similar comparison table comparing to AWS. Those comparison can give one a quick start to adopt their services without major issues. Even those following providers provide migration tools for migrating from aws to their platform.</description>

      <description>Summary: Reduce the chance of resource conflict in gitops by reducing the time window of using shared resource files
 My initial journal with gitops was setup my gitops cicd pipeline following the flux tutorial way. I immediately found out the limitation of flux at that time and sought alternative solutions. After comparing different solutions, I settled down argo-cd.
 After a short while usage of argo-cd, I moved configration yamls and kustomization.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I spent one or two hours to resolve a pending order issue. I encountered the issue before when I configured cert-manager with ACME. However after a short while detour to flutter(ios,android) development, I couldn’t quickly locate the root causes. This made me think that it is better off to note down the lessons I leant here.
 DNS01 vs HTTP01 HTTP01 is quite easy to setup for one domain name.</description>

      <description>I can make it works when using device_preview and getx GetMaterialApp. GetMaterialApp can perfectly works with device_preview on many things such as size, orientation etc. GetMaterialApp.router is not the case. I found that locale changes in device_preview can’t propagate to GetMaterialApp.router.
 I raised a issue, however getx has a bad reputation on fixing issues. I can’t wait so long and I sought other options. Things I tried was to use GetMaterialApp, however always to get several errors.</description>

      <description>Terraform site gives several use cases and comparison with other IaC langauges. I think there are few things of terraform that stand out when comparing it with other tools such as cloudformation, ARM tempaltes IaC languages.
 multi-cloud deployment When you only use one cloud-provider’s solution to do IaC and things get in your way, you will have hard time to migrate to other providers as you already invested heavily into one provider.</description>

Initial I encountered the issue, I desperately wanted to resolved the issue. I tried several ways to do that by using solutions from web, however I didn’t get my issue resolved. Due to time constraint, I went back to the old mvn way to do the project. Today I have sometime to revisit the issue now.</description>

      <description>The real differences is quoted here. You can find the content here
 A kustomization that is marked as a Component has basically the same capabilities as a normal kustomization. The main distinction is that they are evaluated after the resources of the parent kustomization (overlay or component) have been accumulated, and on top of them. This means that: A component with transformers can transform the resources that an overlay has previously specified in the resources field.</description>

      <description>Today I was asked which framework was used in my design of microservice systems. I answered those concerns of microservice are handled natively by kubernetes when my systems are deployed into kubernetes clusters. I will not use those frameworks in my design of microservices.
 The question sparked several questions in my mind. Here are those questions. Why do we still need microservice frameworks when kubernetes is the de-facto platform now?</description>

      <description>In normal kubernetes metrics, you will find cAdvisor, Metrics Server, Kubernetes API Server, Node Exporter, and Kube-State-Metrics as source of metrics. In last 2 days, I noticed prometheus-adapter. Today KEDA popped up in my mind. I checked its website and found it can be source of metric as well.
 cAdvisor, Metrics Server, Kubernetes API Server, Node Exporter, and Kube-State-Metrics can be considered as in-cluster source of metric. However KEDA is about out-cluster source of metrics.</description>

   put the feature vectors into postgresql database
  create distanced based index
   I adopted the model and algrithm from face_recognition, and my team trained on sample faces from our internal system to improve the accuracy to reduce the human involvement and save costs. During development, we found that there is a limit of postgres: CUBE_MAX_DIM, my team customize the build of postgreql to work around the limit.</description>

Prometheus and grafana are the de-facto standards. It’s a no-brainer choice. The most important things is how to make them working together.
 Setup Prometheus and Grafana kubectl create namespace monitoring helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts helm repo update helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus -n monitoring helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts helm install grafana grafana/grafana -n monitoring kubectl get secret --namespace monitoring grafana -o jsonpath=&amp;#34;{.</description>

      <description>Today I had a case to expose serveral kubernetes dashboard with cert-manager. Initiallly I thought it should be quite easy to setup, but the reality was quite different. My intial yaml is as following.
 apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: ingress-global-dash namespace: kubernetes-dashboard labels: name: ingress-global-dash use-http01-solver: &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; annotations: cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: &amp;#34;test-issuer&amp;#34; spec: ingressClassName: nginx rules: - host: &amp;#34;dashboard.example.com&amp;#34; http: paths: - pathType: Prefix path: &amp;#34;/&amp;#34; backend: service: name: kubernetes-dashboard port: number: 80 #later changed to 443 according to port of kubernetes-dashboard svc tls: # &amp;lt; placing a host in the TLS config will determine what ends up in the cert&amp;#39;s subjectAltNames - hosts: - dashboard.</description>

 cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Singapore /etc/localtime echo &amp;#39;Asia/Singapore&amp;#39; &amp;gt; /etc/timezone   You can indeed get the correct time if you run it in dotnet core 5 docker linux containers. However you couldn’t get the correct local time in dotnet 6.0. I found the issue About time incorrect of docker image about aspnet-6 #62545. After I tried serveral combinations mentioned in the issue, finally I got a working solution.</description>

      <description>Prologue I never thought I will use nginx extensively in systems I involved after I found that nginx ingress has some limitations comparing to istio in 2021. Nginx is more than reverse proxy or webservers which I thought initially after several months of extensive usage in the past. Here I list serveral advanced use case I countered or discussed with other experts.

      <description>I only noticed the steps after one ergent cancelling of creating. I didn’t find corresponding nodes and wondered what happened. I deleted my cluster and recreated one.
 I knew I can create nodegroup after creating cluster and not sure if I can do those sub tasks this way as well. Leave it here for later investigation.
 2 sequential tasks: { create cluster control plane &amp;#34;uat-local-intl&amp;#34;, 2 sequential sub-tasks: { 4 sequential sub-tasks: { wait for control plane to become ready, associate IAM OIDC provider, 4 parallel sub-tasks: { 2 sequential sub-tasks: { create IAM role for serviceaccount &amp;#34;backend-apps/s3-reader&amp;#34;, create serviceaccount &amp;#34;backend-apps/s3-reader&amp;#34;, }, 2 sequential sub-tasks: { create IAM role for serviceaccount &amp;#34;backend-apps/cache-access&amp;#34;, create serviceaccount &amp;#34;backend-apps/cache-access&amp;#34;, }, 2 sequential sub-tasks: { create IAM role for serviceaccount &amp;#34;kube-system/cluster-autoscaler&amp;#34;, create serviceaccount &amp;#34;kube-system/cluster-autoscaler&amp;#34;, }, 2 sequential sub-tasks: { create IAM role for serviceaccount &amp;#34;kube-system/aws-node&amp;#34;, create serviceaccount &amp;#34;kube-system/aws-node&amp;#34;, }, }, restart daemonset &amp;#34;kube-system/aws-node&amp;#34;, }, create nodegroup &amp;#34;ng-1&amp;#34;, } }   </description>

      <description>In the past I knew jsonnet, however I didn’t commit too much time to learn it until recently I encountered a data driven scenario, generating istio yaml configurations based on an array of data. The scenario is business driven, and I can foresee that there will be more data coming. What a waste of time to repeat the copy/paste procedures with little tweaks. I hated to do that again and again.</description>

      <description>I started one of my certificates using cert-manager and letsencrypt without root domain in one product system. Later I tried to add root domain to the certificate as our customer requested withou success at first day. I figured out how to do that next morning. Here are my the success one and several failed attempts.
 Here some background information of this system: gitops + argocd
 Successful solution Considering that the app argocd is in manual synchronization mode, I can do that changes in place in kubernetes instead of the git repo.</description>

 I learnt ChatOps in the past when I first heard hubot. Later GitOps and Kubernetes grabbed my attention. I didn’t see how ChatOps fit in GitOps until I saw this 湾区日报是如何运作的？ today after I implemented an integration with telegram bot APIs.
 What Are the Benefits of ChatOps? enumerates the benefits. In my eyes I saw other benefits or more benefits in productivity when considing the full potentials of ChatOps.</description>

      <description>TLDR: my CICD choice: argo-cd and argo-workflow
Since I chose argocd and github action as our CICD pipeline two years ago, I rarely thought about other choices and the reason I made the choices. Recently I leant from several sources that jenkins is still widely used, it arouse my interest on this subject again. I reconsidered my choice and layed out the reasons here for my future references.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good impression with java in my past java projects.</description>

      <description>Since my first time to configure istio with proxy protocol supports in aws, istio and envoyproxy changed a lot. In the past several days, I was exposed to a different scenario that one service to expose into multiple domains.
 Things are getting not straighforward, I struggled to make it success yesterday. Today another layer of complexity was added into my cluster: an extra ingressgateway for some services.
 For multiple ingress gateways, I followed this article, however my setup is more complex than that.</description>

I got the same issue when I tried to do the Curl elk in pods to delete indices this afternoon.

 When things go wrong, you can’t login kibana to do management or maintainance works. The left option is managing the data from the command line. In the past I figured out to use curl cli in pod to get some information of elk.</description>

      <description>I wrote this on September 7, 2021 and published it on linkedin. However I found that it can be hard to search if I put there. so I put here anoter copy
 TLDR: if your external SMTP is using port 80 instead of standard ports in an istio mesh, create a Service Entry for the external SMTP.
 These two days, a strange timeout issue happened in one of our kubernetes clusters when trying to send emails via SMTP even though the same configuration works perfectly on our development machines.</description>

 An idempotency and immutable infrastructure has a slew of benefits. I am a firm believer of it and I did my best to keep several projects in that way. In the past few weeks, I helped one friend to resolve system structure, performance issue and development experience of one of his projects.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I added gitconfig volume and mounted to /root. However today the logs of the workflow shows netrc is mounted to /root as well. They are conflicted. Kubernetes supports projected volume which supports following types. my netrc and gitconfig are in the list.
   secret
  downwardAPI
  configMap
  serviceAccountToken
   I made the small tweak to hello world sample workflow. Here is the my demo workflow with projected volumes.</description>

      <description>Since I read the textual UML in the 2015 techradar, I am a big fan of it. I used plantuml in my technical writing in Asia Fusion Technology. Later I found asciidoc, and I wanted to combine the two together. I regularly read techradar from thoughtworks and found mermaidjs in NOV 2018 techradar. However it was little hard to integrate that into my site at that time. Today I knew Hugo supports Mermaid Diagrams easily.</description>

      <description>Prologue Today I migrated several golang projects to golang 1.18. I had several hiccups today. Let’s called docker buildx multi-context, multi-platform, multi-stage and secrets in action.
   Multi-platform I started to look into one iOS and android app of our projects one week ago, and started to use Mac Air M1. Mac Air M1 is arm64 based, however our production environment is amd64 based. I had to do some changes to make the images built on my or my colleagues&amp;#39; machine can be runnable in production environment.</description>

      <description>I had some projects on github, gitlab and gitee. Their CI pipelines are quite different. To save the troubles and times, it is a natural choice to seek other options to unify on one solution.
 At first, I looked into jenkins x. However it is quite heavy and with opinions. Considering its Maturity Level Matrix, I am not sure I can make it happen in my limited after hours times.</description>

      <description>I needed to clone one of my private repositories in one workflow of argo-workflows. I did’t figure a way to mount git artifact into a shared volume at that time. I sought to other options and find https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428 and https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/mounting-kubernetes-secret-single-file-inside-pod.
 The comment https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428#issuecomment-775911838 gives an example to add user name and password into https url. Upon I checked the logs, I found that user and password are shown in the logs of a workflow.</description>

      <description>Today I found my argo-events sensor executed triggers which I was not intended to. In the logs, I found that ref fields of those non-intended triggers all started with &amp;#34;refs/heads/dev&amp;#34;. I checked again with document and found this surprising truth:
 https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/sensors/filters/data/#:~:text=If%20data%20type%20is%20string%2C%20you%20can%20pass%20either%20an%20exact%20value%20or%20a%20regex.%20In%20any%20case%20that%20value%20will%20be%20evaluated%20as%20a%20regex.
 If data type is string, you can pass either an exact value or a regex. In any case that value will be evaluated as a regex.   Considing my following data filter, no wonder it triggers more than I expected.</description>

      <description>Webhook of argo-events supports authentication, however the field is fixed in header. If your callers don’t do that way, you are screwed. Recently days, I was trying to integrate gitee with argo-workflow and argo-events. I hit the wall here.
 TOKEN=&amp;#34;Bearer af3qqs321f2ddwf1e2e67dfda3fs&amp;#34; curl -X POST -H &amp;#34;Authorization: $TOKEN&amp;#34; -d &amp;#34;{your data}&amp;#34; http://xxxxx:12000/example   I kept reading the documents for serveral days and the knowledge sinked in, I got the idea that filters maybe can be used for that as a workaround solution.</description>

      <description>Usually I don’t want to blog about something, espicially I don’t contribute some original things to internet. Of couse, there are other reasons as well.
 There were many reasons which stopped me in the past to writing. One was that my vocabulary was limited. I started my blogging actitivies back to 2004. At that time, my vocabulary was limited, I think the size of my vocabulary was in the range from 6000-7000 and most words were memorized in isolated way.</description>

      <description>I wrote my blogs using Jekyll at this domain almost two years occasionally from 2018 until 2020. I didn’t think to move to Hugo before it was used in one of my company project. After two or three weeks since the project kicked off, I had a thought why not move to Hugo considering several benefits.
 For the uninitiated, Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.</description>

      <description>Today I encountered a strange issue with one kubernete cluster. Newly created pods are not created on a newly joined node. There is no errors in logs of pods and the node, events of kubernete. All seems normal. I created a simple nginx pod with nodeName as the problematic node. The pod can be scheduled and created in the node. However the pod was kept in CrashloopBackOff state. There is definitely something wrong with server.</description>

 I followed the instruction to install dapr vs code extension in dapr. My environment is WSL based. I tried several times to try to debug the dapr applications and failed. I noticed in the following screenshot that there was a warning icon before kubernetes.</description>

      <description>TLDR: Bazel is definitely worth to use on your projects even though it has minimum supports of some languages such as C#.
   Prologue Before I was interested in bazel, I always thought why bother to learn a new building system even I knew that kubernetes once was built with bazel. 4 months ago, I was involved in a micro service structured project. I was dissatisfied with dev workflow using skaffold and I looked other options in the market.</description>

I tried different combination of controller and summerwind/actions-runner-dind image, fully customized template portion with RUNNER_xxx arguments. I still got &amp;#34;Http response code: NotFound from &amp;#39;POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration&amp;#39;&amp;#34; for every combination of those combinations in the logs of runner pods. I thought RunnerDeployment is stateless and less complex than RunnerSet. I gave it a try.</description>

      <description>TLDR: if your external SMTP is using port 80 instead of standard ports in an istio mesh, create a Service Entry for the external SMTP.
 These two days, a strange timeout issue happened in one of our kubernetes clusters when trying to send emails via SMTP even though the same configuration works perfectly on our development machines.
 At first, I thought it was due to SecureSocketOptions.startTLS. I changed it to SecureSocketOptions.</description>

 There are two ways to do that in alibaba classic load balancer: http/https listeners, and TCP listeners with proxy protocol
 HTTPS listeners is crossed out due to certificate issue. HTTPS listeners can use integrated certificates or self uploaded certificates.</description>

      <description>Secrets Management is the strong suit of Hashicorp vault. Open source edition is little limited comparing to cloud and enterprise edition, and cloud and enterprise editions sometimes are not allowed due to some reasons. bank-vaults seems a promising solution based on open source edition of Hashicorp Vault.
 Advanced usage of vault will involve HSM and SoftHSM is good start point without spending several hundards bucks. Besides, HSM is widely used in Financial sector, blockchain and cryptocurrency.</description>

Our applications are deployed on kubernetes, I focused on ACK first. The setup journey was bumpy, and most of the issues can be resolved by googling and trial loops. The most difficult one is that dns resolution issue.
 I tried the steps in &amp;#34;Debugging DNS Resolution&amp;#34; [1]. All steps were good except the nslookup step.</description>

      <description>Several months ago, I resolved the issue &amp;#34;404 Error on refresh with SPA&amp;#34; by using nginx try_files directive, this time it was quite different as the apps were deployed into kubernetes. I tried nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex:true and nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1. To avoid to block others to others to use staging environment, I setup an skaffold local development environment to troubeshooting the issue. I tried following annotation as well.
 nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | try_files $uri $uri/ /index.</description>

      <description>During practicing the lifecycle handlers of pod, I found it is quite difficult to get the logs logged from preStop handlers. Initially I thought terminationMessagePath maybe is the answer, but no such luck. The preStop handler will be run before the pod is deleted. After deleted, there is no way to get the logs unless those logs are kept in other place such as central log servers etc. Those settings are way complex for a simple practice and time-consuming.</description>

 Google cloud python code vscode plugin 1.7.0 failed to run python on kubernetes or there is no obvious way to do that as depicted in the below pic.      Steps to make it:
  run
skaffold debug     Import ptvsd in the python file to debug, add breakout() before the line to debug</description>

 I read several articles before I tried the aboved one. The successful debug after several trial and errors. I added skaffold.yaml to the project and installed Cloud Code. skaffold.yaml can be found at https://github.com/jackliusr/dockerdev/tree/kubernetes-debug. Other jetbrain configuration can be seen in the below pictures.
          cloud code is a very good tool.</description>

      <description>Today one of my deployments always got CrashLoopBackOff. Searching internet don’t gave me the root cause of those errors even I went through all the steps. Steps from internets are all about describe, logs, liveProbe etc. I noticed the reason and exit code in last state when I described one of the pod. It should be the focus point to find root cause of CrashBoopBackOff.

      <description>I am a big fan of Tex and asciidoc. Asciidoctor is ruby based and can been easily integrated into jekyll. Hugo currently still has some rough edges in asciidoc integration. Considering the time and effort to switch to Hugo, it is not worth to do that.

 yarn yarn build
 I run into module not found issues when I try to run those examples under the repository of redus-saga. Even following comments in github issues and stackoverflow, those solutions don’t work out.
 Scripts in the package.json of the root folder don’t work for examples.
 After run yarn &amp;amp;&amp;amp; yarn build, can change directories to those examples and run them.</description>

      <description>Asynchronization is very hard. It brings benefits with several catches for backend programming. Here is serveral catches and respective solutions. However all those will increase the cost of developments.
   Hard to debug and trace As the process breaks down to serveral asynchronious subprocesses, it is very difficult to relate all information of the process when something goes wrong. An extra overhead correlation Id is needed to adopt to ameliorate this issue.</description>

      <description>I always thought SaaS are based shardig, load balance and multiple-tenant. In the past several days, I re-read Dynamo and DynamoDB papers to figure out some key info to share with my colleages to find a common ground about DynamoDB. One thing is mentioned many times in DynamoDB is token-bucket. Suddenly a thought popped out my mind when I walked back after lunch with my colleague that token-bucket algorithm should be a component of SaaS and multiple-tenant.</description>

      <description>When I was preparing a slides to recommend broad usage of JsonSchema, somethings I thought are good to have for general public usage. Those things troubled me for a while during I authored a JsonSchema.
 Versioning Currently there is no standard way how to define a version for a schema. I might use a version property for that. SemVer is good fit for the version content schema. Use if and else for different version.</description>
