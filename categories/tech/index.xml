      <description>TLDR: Bazel is definitely worth to use on your projects even though it has minimum supports of some languages such as C#.
   Prologue Before I was interested in bazel, I always thought why bother to learn a new building system even I knew that kubernetes once was built with bazel. 4 months ago, I was involved in a micro service structured project. I was dissatisfied with dev workflow using skaffold and I looked other options in the market.</description>

      <description>Last week I setup our staging kubernetes environment, however the once worked version of runnerset yaml configuration didn’t work. I tried different combination of controller and summerwind/actions-runner-dind image, fully customized template portion with RUNNER_xxx arguments. I still got &amp;#34;Http response code: NotFound from &amp;#39;POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration&amp;#39;&amp;#34; for every combination of those combinations in the logs of runner pods. I thought RunnerDeployment is stateless and less complex than RunnerSet. I gave it a try.</description>

      <description>Two days ago, our web applications need to get clients&amp;#39; real IP address. Our sites is hosted in kubernetes, isito is used for ingress controll. behind cloud load balancers, it is not easy to make it work.
 There are two ways to do that in alibaba classic load balancer: http/https listeners, and TCP listeners with proxy protocol
 HTTPS listeners is crossed out due to certificate issue. HTTPS listeners can use integrated certificates or self uploaded certificates.</description>

  run the downloaded executable, and say install it at c:\software\opencv
  run opencv\build\setup_vars_opencv4.cmd
   After above steps, your environment is ready. However there is a caveat, the environment is ephemeral.

      <description>Secrets Management is the strong suit of Hashicorp vault. Open source edition is little limited comparing to cloud and enterprise edition, and cloud and enterprise editions sometimes are not allowed due to some reasons. bank-vaults seems a promising solution based on open source edition of Hashicorp Vault.
 Advanced usage of vault will involve HSM and SoftHSM is good start point without spending several hundards bucks. Besides, HSM is widely used in Financial sector, blockchain and cryptocurrency.</description>

      <description>2 weeks I started to learn alicloud to prepare the migration from aws to alicloud. I started the migration this week. Our applications are deployed on kubernetes, I focused on ACK first. The setup journey was bumpy, and most of the issues can be resolved by googling and trial loops. The most difficult one is that dns resolution issue.
 I tried the steps in &amp;#34;Debugging DNS Resolution&amp;#34; [1]. All steps were good except the nslookup step.</description>

      <description>Several months ago, I resolved the issue &amp;#34;404 Error on refresh with SPA&amp;#34; by using nginx try_files directive, this time it was quite different as the apps were deployed into kubernetes. I tried nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex:true and nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1. To avoid to block others to others to use staging environment, I setup an skaffold local development environment to troubeshooting the issue. I tried following annotation as well.
 nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | try_files $uri $uri/ /index.</description>

      <description>During practicing the lifecycle handlers of pod, I found it is quite difficult to get the logs logged from preStop handlers. Initially I thought terminationMessagePath maybe is the answer, but no such luck. The preStop handler will be run before the pod is deleted. After deleted, there is no way to get the logs unless those logs are kept in other place such as central log servers etc. Those settings are way complex for a simple practice and time-consuming.</description>

 Google cloud python code vscode plugin 1.7.0 failed to run python on kubernetes or there is no obvious way to do that as depicted in the below pic.      Steps to make it:
  run
skaffold debug     Import ptvsd in the python file to debug, add breakout() before the line to debug</description>

 I read several articles before I tried the aboved one. The successful debug after several trial and errors. I added skaffold.yaml to the project and installed Cloud Code. skaffold.yaml can be found at https://github.com/jackliusr/dockerdev/tree/kubernetes-debug. Other jetbrain configuration can be seen in the below pictures.
          cloud code is a very good tool.</description>

      <description>Today one of my deployments always got CrashLoopBackOff. Searching internet don’t gave me the root cause of those errors even I went through all the steps. Steps from internets are all about describe, logs, liveProbe etc. I noticed the reason and exit code in last state when I described one of the pod. It should be the focus point to find root cause of CrashBoopBackOff.
 Containers: nginx: Container ID: containerd://9570e7e67d83692fdbe0e0871919a81222137fcaee2eaecb1eff6b772ec805b1 Image: nginx:1.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of Tex and asciidoc. Asciidoctor is ruby based and can been easily integrated into jekyll. Hugo currently still has some rough edges in asciidoc integration. Considering the time and effort to switch to Hugo, it is not worth to do that.

 Scripts in the package.json of the root folder don’t work for examples.
 After run yarn &amp;amp;&amp;amp; yarn build, can change directories to those examples and run them.</description>

      <description>I was not familiar with SIP states during the integration of VoIP products such as twilio, plivo and sinch. I am still confused about the state changes after reading documents. Here try to visualize the state change and help me to remember it. The state chart is based on my understanding. It is not necessarily correct. It is just for my reference.

      <description>Asynchronization is very hard. It brings benefits with several catches for backend programming. Here is serveral catches and respective solutions. However all those will increase the cost of developments.
   Hard to debug and trace As the process breaks down to serveral asynchronious subprocesses, it is very difficult to relate all information of the process when something goes wrong. An extra overhead correlation Id is needed to adopt to ameliorate this issue.</description>
