      <description>I did resize volume of kubernetes in the past, however I encountered an interesting issue when I did the resizing in different way.
 According to doc, I should only change the requested size in pvc. Today I changed the size of pv first, then pvc. Here was the interesting thing: all things of pv and pvc are fine, but the size of the file system in pod was not changed.</description>
