      <description>Recently I added Crashlytics into my project on Oct 25, 2022. I encountered this issue and spent a while to fix it. Today I had to figure out how to do it again, and spent a while. I hated to do that again, so here is this article.

      <description>Last three days, I found an issue can only be reproduced in realease mode.The beta testing cycle via testflight takes too long and it definitely is not the option. I debugged my application in iOS before. One thing popped up in my mind whether I can put release mode of my application into iOS using the debug tool of vs code.
 I changed my launch.json as below in my project and debug my application.</description>

      <description>In the last week, I intermittently worked on how to compile a flutter project conditionally like the way c/c++ in busy daily work schedules. I knew that flavor is the way to go, however there are still serveral issues opened to explore to make it better or to understand the rationale behind the scene.
