      <description>Here is an issue with aws-ebs-csi-driver: The size of file system doesnâ€™t change when pvc is expanded. I got the same issue when I tried to do the Curl elk in pods to delete indices this afternoon. I got the message &amp;#34;resize2fs 1.44.5 (15-Dec-2018) open: No such file or directory while opening /dev/nvme1n1&amp;#34; as well when I tried to resize the file system /dev/nvme1n1 in my pod.
 As the issue is about csidriver, it is not in the the result of running command &amp;#34;kubectl get csidriver&amp;#34; on my cluster.</description>
