      <description>Immutable infrastructure is a concept that has revolutionized the way we think about deploying and maintaining systems. It ensures that once an instance of infrastructure is created, it is never modified. Instead, any changes require the creation of a new instance. This approach enhances consistency, reduces configuration drift, and simplifies rollback processes. While immutable infrastructure is often associated with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and containers, it’s entirely possible—and sometimes necessary—to implement it with Virtual Machines (VMs) instead of containers.</description>
