      <description>Yesterday I added gitconfig volume and mounted to /root. However today the logs of the workflow shows netrc is mounted to /root as well. They are conflicted. Kubernetes supports projected volume which supports following types. my netrc and gitconfig are in the list.
   secret
  downwardAPI
  configMap
  serviceAccountToken
   I made the small tweak to hello world sample workflow. Here is the my demo workflow with projected volumes.</description>
