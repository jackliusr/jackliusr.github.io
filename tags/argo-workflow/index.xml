      <description>I needed to clone one of my private repositories in one workflow of argo-workflows. I didâ€™t figure a way to mount git artifact into a shared volume at that time. I sought to other options and find https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428 and https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/mounting-kubernetes-secret-single-file-inside-pod.
 The comment https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428#issuecomment-775911838 gives an example to add user name and password into https url. Upon I checked the logs, I found that user and password are shown in the logs of a workflow.</description>

Argo-workflow supports loop over a list of items, however one of my steps always got &amp;#34;invalid character &amp;#39;G&amp;#39; looking for beginning of value&amp;#34; before going to next step in the workflow template. The step is as following:
 - name: get-deps inputs: parameters: - name: changes script: image: ubuntu:latest command: [bash] #args: [&amp;#34;echo result was: {{inputs.</description>
