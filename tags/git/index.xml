      <description>I used .netrc in several projects and I wrote something about that. I thought it is a convenient way for git until recently.
 Recently I have a new laptop and want to setup my git credentials. This time, I noticed .netrc might not be secure as other applications that use cURL to make requests to servers defined in your .netrc file will also now be authenticated using these credentials.</description>

      <description>I needed to clone one of my private repositories in one workflow of argo-workflows. I didâ€™t figure a way to mount git artifact into a shared volume at that time. I sought to other options and find https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428 and https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/mounting-kubernetes-secret-single-file-inside-pod.
 The comment https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428#issuecomment-775911838 gives an example to add user name and password into https url. Upon I checked the logs, I found that user and password are shown in the logs of a workflow.</description>
