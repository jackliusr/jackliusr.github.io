      <description>Say in a situtation where budget is fixed, what will you do to improve system performance?
 I came out several solutions to this at first, later I came out with more thoughts. I list them here for later reference.
  create selective indexes
  partition tables
  materialized view
  asynchrous processing: put non real-time operations as a job queue, spread jobs to non business hours, non peak loading time etc.</description>
