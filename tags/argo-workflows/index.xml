      <description>TLDR: my CICD choice: argo-cd and argo-workflow
Since I chose argocd and github action as our CICD pipeline two years ago, I rarely thought about other choices and the reason I made the choices. Recently I leant from several sources that jenkins is still widely used, it arouse my interest on this subject again. I reconsidered my choice and layed out the reasons here for my future references.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good impression with java in my past java projects.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I added gitconfig volume and mounted to /root. However today the logs of the workflow shows netrc is mounted to /root as well. They are conflicted. Kubernetes supports projected volume which supports following types. my netrc and gitconfig are in the list.
   secret
  downwardAPI
  configMap
  serviceAccountToken
   I made the small tweak to hello world sample workflow. Here is the my demo workflow with projected volumes.</description>

      <description>I had some projects on github, gitlab and gitee. Their CI pipelines are quite different. To save the troubles and times, it is a natural choice to seek other options to unify on one solution.
 At first, I looked into jenkins x. However it is quite heavy and with opinions. Considering its Maturity Level Matrix, I am not sure I can make it happen in my limited after hours times.</description>

      <title>argo-workflow: secrets for git</title>

      <description>I needed to clone one of my private repositories in one workflow of argo-workflows. I didâ€™t figure a way to mount git artifact into a shared volume at that time. I sought to other options and find https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428 and https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/mounting-kubernetes-secret-single-file-inside-pod.
 The comment https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1428#issuecomment-775911838 gives an example to add user name and password into https url. Upon I checked the logs, I found that user and password are shown in the logs of a workflow.</description>

      <description>The journey I worked on a dapr microservice project which need to read a list from a file and do some useful things. Argo-workflow supports loop over a list of items, however one of my steps always got &amp;#34;invalid character &amp;#39;G&amp;#39; looking for beginning of value&amp;#34; before going to next step in the workflow template. The step is as following:
 - name: get-deps inputs: parameters: - name: changes script: image: ubuntu:latest command: [bash] #args: [&amp;#34;echo result was: {{inputs.</description>
