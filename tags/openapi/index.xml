      <description>Background I worked on APIs and OpenAPI Spec (OAS) in past projects, even I used stoplight and NLP for open-source API style guide enforce and linting. I thought I was quite good at jsonschema. I dont’k think so after recent usage of jsonschema for a very aspnet flexible configuration file.
 Configurations in dotnet are quite straight forwards if all the configurations following the Options pattern. ConfigurationProcessor is not that case.</description>

      <description>Background I didn’t find a rule implementation of spectral at stoplightio and github to lint the rule that resources should be nouns in REST API. stoplight mentions that Use Nouns for Resource Names, however there is no another article about that. I was bothered by that for a while to the point I want to give it a try to implement my rule for that.
 There are several existing implementations about this rule.</description>
