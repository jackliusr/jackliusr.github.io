      <description>My credit of Visual Studio Professional Subscription azure is $50. In the past two days, I activated my subscription. I didn’t go IaC way to setup my POC environment as I did’t have enough time to do that. After I setup more services, the 10 credit is used. It can be quickly used up if resources are kept running. I know there is a way to import existing resources as I used terraform in the past.</description>

      <description>Terraform site gives several use cases and comparison with other IaC langauges. I think there are few things of terraform that stand out when comparing it with other tools such as cloudformation, ARM tempaltes IaC languages.
 multi-cloud deployment When you only use one cloud-provider’s solution to do IaC and things get in your way, you will have hard time to migrate to other providers as you already invested heavily into one provider.</description>
