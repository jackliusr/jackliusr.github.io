      <description>Today I found my argo-events sensor executed triggers which I was not intended to. In the logs, I found that ref fields of those non-intended triggers all started with &amp;#34;refs/heads/dev&amp;#34;. I checked again with document and found this surprising truth:
 If data type is string, you can pass either an exact value or a regex. In any case that value will be evaluated as a regex.   Considing my following data filter, no wonder it triggers more than I expected.</description>

      <description>Webhook of argo-events supports authentication, however the field is fixed in header. If your callers donâ€™t do that way, you are screwed. Recently days, I was trying to integrate gitee with argo-workflow and argo-events. I hit the wall here.
 TOKEN=&amp;#34;Bearer af3qqs321f2ddwf1e2e67dfda3fs&amp;#34; curl -X POST -H &amp;#34;Authorization: $TOKEN&amp;#34; -d &amp;#34;{your data}&amp;#34; http://xxxxx:12000/example   I kept reading the documents for serveral days and the knowledge sinked in, I got the idea that filters maybe can be used for that as a workaround solution.</description>
