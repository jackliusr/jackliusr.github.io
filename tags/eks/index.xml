      <description>Today I needed to scale one of my kubernetes clusterss. Those keys are not in my new laptop since I used Mac Air M1. I didn’t see the increase of nodes several minutes after I run the eksctl scale command. I logged into aws console and found there were several &amp;#34;Failed&amp;#34; messages in activity history of the autoscaling group. All the failed messages shown &amp;#34;Launching a new EC2 instance. Status Reason: The aaaa-nodegroup-ng-1-67:8e:b8:8e:33:83:93:68 key pair does not exist.</description>

      <description>Low resource usage Our system had low resource usage, however my several pods got stucked in ContainerCreating state. Kubernetes events show that &amp;#34;add cmd: failed to assign an IP address to container&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;kubectl top nodes&amp;#34; still shows the usage of resources still low.

      <description>Last week I setup our staging kubernetes environment, however the once worked version of runnerset yaml configuration didn’t work. I tried different combination of controller and summerwind/actions-runner-dind image, fully customized template portion with RUNNER_xxx arguments. I still got &amp;#34;Http response code: NotFound from &amp;#39;POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration&amp;#39;&amp;#34; for every combination of those combinations in the logs of runner pods. I thought RunnerDeployment is stateless and less complex than RunnerSet. I gave it a try.</description>
