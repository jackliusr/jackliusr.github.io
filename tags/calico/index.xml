      <description>2 weeks I started to learn alicloud to prepare the migration from aws to alicloud. I started the migration this week. Our applications are deployed on kubernetes, I focused on ACK first. The setup journey was bumpy, and most of the issues can be resolved by googling and trial loops. The most difficult one is that dns resolution issue.
 I tried the steps in &#34;Debugging DNS Resolution&#34; [1]. All steps were good except the nslookup step.</description>
