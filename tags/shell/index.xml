      <description>My first attemp to resolve &amp;#34;Kubernetes Time Check Pod&amp;#34; in https://engineer.kodekloud.com is not successful. The exercise doesn’t allow to open an editor to edit a yaml file. I had to resort to cat. I attempted several times to resolve it on my local cluster, still no luck even I tried different combination such as command, args,string in string, avoiding expansion. This one from stackoverfow gave me a clue how to resolve my issue.</description>

      <description>Do you know how to skip first line before data pipe into xargs?
 Today I need to export custom resources and want to avoid error messages because the column names line in the output of kubectl. I knew there is a command line option (--no-headers) of kubectl and managed to get the option, but I don’t want to spend time to search the option in future. Is there any way to skip first line before data pipe into xargs?</description>

      <description>During practicing the lifecycle handlers of pod, I found it is quite difficult to get the logs logged from preStop handlers. Initially I thought terminationMessagePath maybe is the answer, but no such luck. The preStop handler will be run before the pod is deleted. After deleted, there is no way to get the logs unless those logs are kept in other place such as central log servers etc. Those settings are way complex for a simple practice and time-consuming.</description>
