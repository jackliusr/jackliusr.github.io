      <description>I was very excited to be invited to give a talk about dapr. Below is my talk. My demo in the session is not successful as things in kubernetes and dapr field are changing very fast. My lab environment didnâ€™t work as expected. Finially I make it work today, I share it here below.
 Here is my talk at 18th July from time 2235 in below video.
    Prerequisites kubectl, kind, docker, dapr, git, vscode in WSL</description>

      <description>Low resource usage Our system had low resource usage, however my several pods got stucked in ContainerCreating state. Kubernetes events show that &amp;#34;add cmd: failed to assign an IP address to container&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;kubectl top nodes&amp;#34; still shows the usage of resources still low.

      <description>Dapr development is quite difficult to setup correctly. You can get the idea from (this issue) as the issue is still open now since it was created.
 I followed the instruction to install dapr vs code extension in dapr. My environment is WSL based. I tried several times to try to debug the dapr applications and failed. I noticed in the following screenshot that there was a warning icon before kubernetes.</description>
