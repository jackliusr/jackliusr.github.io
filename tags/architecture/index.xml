      <description>Just an architecture style MACH got me attention. It is short for micro service based, API first, cloud native, headless. There are two of projects I involved one are in this architecture style. One is sitecore based, another one is developed. Kubernetes, nodejs, npm, strapi tsoa are used. Their mapping is as following.
   micro services based: multiple services based on expressjs
  api first: tsao
  cloud native: more advanced than cloud native, kubernate native is used.</description>
