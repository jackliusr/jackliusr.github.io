      <description>Usually I tell others that I have about 5 years experience of aws services. Today I want to know more about how many years experience I have. I logged in my aws account and tried to find my account creation date. There is no such information in account page. I was so eager to find the information and searched for alternative way to get that information. The easiest way is good one, however I already deleted the email.</description>

      <description>Since my first time to configure istio with proxy protocol supports in aws, istio and envoyproxy changed a lot. In the past several days, I was exposed to a different scenario that one service to expose into multiple domains.
 Things are getting not straighforward, I struggled to make it success yesterday. Today another layer of complexity was added into my cluster: an extra ingressgateway for some services.
 For multiple ingress gateways, I followed this article, however my setup is more complex than that.</description>

      <description>When I tried to create an user for application instead of giving out the master user and its password. I got &amp;#34;Error Code: 1045. Access denied for user &amp;#39;mysqladmin&amp;#39;@&amp;#39;%&amp;#39; (using password: YES)&amp;#34; when I run &amp;#34;GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON demodb.* TO &amp;#39;appadmin&amp;#39;@&amp;#39;%&amp;#39;;&amp;#34;.
 I tried the method in How do I create another master user for my Amazon RDS DB instance that is running MySQL?, it is for creating another master user with more permissions than an app db user.</description>

      <description>I did resize volume of kubernetes in the past, however I encountered an interesting issue when I did the resizing in different way.
 According to doc, I should only change the requested size in pvc. Today I changed the size of pv first, then pvc. Here was the interesting thing: all things of pv and pvc are fine, but the size of the file system in pod was not changed.</description>

      <description>Today I needed to scale one of my kubernetes clusterss. Those keys are not in my new laptop since I used Mac Air M1. I didnâ€™t see the increase of nodes several minutes after I run the eksctl scale command. I logged into aws console and found there were several &amp;#34;Failed&amp;#34; messages in activity history of the autoscaling group. All the failed messages shown &amp;#34;Launching a new EC2 instance. Status Reason: The aaaa-nodegroup-ng-1-67:8e:b8:8e:33:83:93:68 key pair does not exist.</description>

      <description>Low resource usage Our system had low resource usage, however my several pods got stucked in ContainerCreating state. Kubernetes events show that &amp;#34;add cmd: failed to assign an IP address to container&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;kubectl top nodes&amp;#34; still shows the usage of resources still low.
