      <description>Today I needed to scale one of my kubernetes clusterss. Those keys are not in my new laptop since I used Mac Air M1. I didn’t see the increase of nodes several minutes after I run the eksctl scale command. I logged into aws console and found there were several &amp;#34;Failed&amp;#34; messages in activity history of the autoscaling group. All the failed messages shown &amp;#34;Launching a new EC2 instance. Status Reason: The aaaa-nodegroup-ng-1-67:8e:b8:8e:33:83:93:68 key pair does not exist.</description>

      <description>I did resize volume of kubernetes in the past, however I encountered an interesting issue when I did the resizing in different way.
 According to doc, I should only change the requested size in pvc. Today I changed the size of pv first, then pvc. Here was the interesting thing: all things of pv and pvc are fine, but the size of the file system in pod was not changed.</description>

      <description>Low resource usage Our system had low resource usage, however my several pods got stucked in ContainerCreating state. Kubernetes events show that &amp;#34;add cmd: failed to assign an IP address to container&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;kubectl top nodes&amp;#34; still shows the usage of resources still low.
