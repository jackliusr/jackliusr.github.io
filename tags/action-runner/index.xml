      <description>Usually I explain one of my CICD pipeline to others with words such like github action + argo-cd. I am not sure if they understand it. A picture is worth a thousand words. Here is my CICD pipeline picture.
      I used excalidraw to draw the diagram. Excalidraw link is https://excalidraw.com/#json=zJHTTZ_QgcarkYCCankS8,gotb3rzXtE8ux810NoK18A. Feel free to use it.

      <description>Last week I setup our staging kubernetes environment, however the once worked version of runnerset yaml configuration didnâ€™t work. I tried different combination of controller and summerwind/actions-runner-dind image, fully customized template portion with RUNNER_xxx arguments. I still got &amp;#34;Http response code: NotFound from &amp;#39;POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration&amp;#39;&amp;#34; for every combination of those combinations in the logs of runner pods. I thought RunnerDeployment is stateless and less complex than RunnerSet. I gave it a try.</description>
