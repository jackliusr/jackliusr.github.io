      <description>It is about three months now. I make reflections on things I have done well and bad. I will refine my learning workflow.
 In the past, I used 2nd-brain, daily-logging, flashcard and spaced-repetition systems to help to accelerate my learning under the circumstance that I canâ€™t get fully complete information from different stake holders. I was left with only way to find it out by myself. I read all material I thought will be useful and noted them down in my logseq vault.</description>
