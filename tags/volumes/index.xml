      <description>I encountered the issue yesterday during my exercise in killer CKA similator. However I made the same mistakes again. I think it worth to write it down to avoid I make the same mistake again.
 In my day to day works, I usually add volumes before containers in the spec section of pods. In exams, sometimes I need to add extra volumes into a existing pod extracted from a running pod, and I still add volumes in the old way.</description>
