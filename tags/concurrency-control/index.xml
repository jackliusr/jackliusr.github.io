      <description>Summary:
 My initial journal with gitops was setup my gitops cicd pipeline following the flux tutorial way. I immediately found out the limitation of flux at that time and sought alternative solutions. After comparing different solutions, I settled down argo-cd.
 After a short while usage of argo-cd, I moved configration yamls and kustomization.yaml files into another repository following the best practice of gitops—​seperate repository for configuration. Things got annoying as we got many failed pushes due to merging conflict.</description>
