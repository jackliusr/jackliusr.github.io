      <description>Prologue One or two years ago, I tried several times to install kind cluster to using cilium cni. However I didn’t make it. Today I really want to setup one after reading an Kind cluster with Cilium and no kube-proxy and considering that major kubernetes distributions are using cilium cni now. After about 3 hours, I finally got it running successfully. Things don’t go smoothly. Here are my steps to setup it up.</description>

      <description>I searched web, first several links in SERP are not the offical one from microsoft. I tried them and failed to install mssql due to errors Error: &amp;#39;deb [arch=amd64 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \ xenial \ stable&amp;#39; invalid] or Can’t install MS SQL Server on Ubuntu 21.10. At last I follow the instruction from microsoft. I successfully installed mssql server in my wsl+ubuntu22.04 environment.
 curl -fsSL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/microsoft-prod.</description>

      <description>Dapr development is quite difficult to setup correctly. You can get the idea from (this issue) as the issue is still open now since it was created.
 I followed the instruction to install dapr vs code extension in dapr. My environment is WSL based. I tried several times to try to debug the dapr applications and failed. I noticed in the following screenshot that there was a warning icon before kubernetes.</description>
