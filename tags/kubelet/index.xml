      <description>My first attemp to resolve &amp;#34;Kubernetes Time Check Pod&amp;#34; in https://engineer.kodekloud.com is not successful. The exercise doesn’t allow to open an editor to edit a yaml file. I had to resort to cat. I attempted several times to resolve it on my local cluster, still no luck even I tried different combination such as command, args,string in string, avoiding expansion. This one from stackoverfow gave me a clue how to resolve my issue.</description>

      <description>In the past several days, I practiced several exercises for my coming CKS exam. I noticed that it takes a while to get static pods restart after configuraiton changes. I was curious if there is any faster way to make that happen. I think the following ways definitely will be faster than waiting 3 minutes after I used them for a while. The observable time is shorter than 3 minutes</description>

      <description>In the past I learnt a lot of kubernetes, however there is no much information about kubelet or not deep enough. I couldn’t answer the questions about kubelet correctly in an interview. Here I put all the information I collected from the internet here for my references.
