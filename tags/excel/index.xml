      <description>I learnt to extract npm package inform from https://registry.npmjs.org/ on 2023-08-31. Today I have more packages. The original query need to be optimized for better performance.
 In the old post, one can quickly spot that the package information is fetched twice. It is the place to optimize today. I will put selected fields into a column, and extract values from the column later. This way, It can spend less time.</description>

      <description>Last week I worked on filling info package information to a workbooks. I used VBA macro before and thought of it again to save some of my time.
 Things is changing very fast, the new javascript based custom fuction is the mainstream. The initial one I followed the tutorial, however I didn’t find any way to add it into &amp;#34;My Addin&amp;#34; as described in microsoft doc site. I don’t have administrator rights on my laptop.</description>
