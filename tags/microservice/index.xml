      <description>Today I was asked which framework was used in my design of microservice systems. I answered those concerns of microservice are handled natively by kubernetes when my systems are deployed into kubernetes clusters. I will not use those frameworks in my design of microservices.
 The question sparked several questions in my mind. Here are those questions. Why do we still need microservice frameworks when kubernetes is the de-facto platform now?</description>
