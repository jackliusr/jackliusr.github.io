      <description>One thing constantly bothered me since I used mermaid for flowchart, how to correctly group elements in a group. Only today I have a thought about what will happen if I put node in subgraph without links between them. Finally I got it works to correctly group elements in a group.
 Another things, mermaid diagram is natively supported in asciidoctor now. This one is my first example to use it.</description>

      <description>Since I read the textual UML in the 2015 techradar, I am a big fan of it. I used plantuml in my technical writing in Asia Fusion Technology. Later I found asciidoc, and I wanted to combine the two together. I regularly read techradar from thoughtworks and found mermaidjs in NOV 2018 techradar. However it was little hard to integrate that into my site at that time. Today I knew Hugo supports Mermaid Diagrams easily.</description>
