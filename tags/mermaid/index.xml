      <description>Since I read the textual UML in the 2015 techradar, I am a big fan of it. I used plantuml in my technical writing in Asia Fusion Technology. Later I found asciidoc, and I wanted to combine the two together. I regularly read techradar from thoughtworks and found mermaidjs in NOV 2018 techradar. However it was little hard to integrate that into my site at that time. Today I knew Hugo supports Mermaid Diagrams easily.</description>
