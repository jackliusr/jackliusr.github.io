      <description>Recently I added Crashlytics into my project on Oct 25, 2022. I encountered this issue and spent a while to fix it. Today I had to figure out how to do it again, and spent a while. I hated to do that again, so here is this article.
 The key message is the first one below. It is quite misleading and lead me to wrong direction to change DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT.</description>

      <description>Last three days, I found an issue can only be reproduced in realease mode.The beta testing cycle via testflight takes too long and it definitely is not the option. I debugged my application in iOS before. One thing popped up in my mind whether I can put release mode of my application into iOS using the debug tool of vs code.
 I changed my launch.json as below in my project and debug my application.</description>
