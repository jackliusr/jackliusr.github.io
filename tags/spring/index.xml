      <description>I thought it was every easy to setup and use it using STS and gradle. The actual story is not so. I changed my settings followed Developing with Spring Boot and some suggestions here in stackoverflow, however liveload and autorestart don’t work.
 After several rounds of trial, I noticed spring boot dashboard. I start my application from there, liveload and autorestart work now.

      <description>In the past two days, I always got the errors &amp;#34;packages cannot be resolved&amp;#34; in eclipse with gradle projects. Initial I encountered the issue, I desperately wanted to resolved the issue. I tried several ways to do that by using solutions from web, however I didn’t get my issue resolved. Due to time constraint, I went back to the old mvn way to do the project. Today I have sometime to revisit the issue now.</description>
