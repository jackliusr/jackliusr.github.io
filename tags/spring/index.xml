      <description>In the past two days, I always got the errors &amp;#34;packages cannot be resolved&amp;#34; in eclipse with gradle projects. Initial I encountered the issue, I desperately wanted to resolved the issue. I tried several ways to do that by using solutions from web, however I didnâ€™t get my issue resolved. Due to time constraint, I went back to the old mvn way to do the project. Today I have sometime to revisit the issue now.</description>
