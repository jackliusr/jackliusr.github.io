      <description>Usually I don’t want to blog about something, espicially I don’t contribute some original things to internet. Of couse, there are other reasons as well.
 There were many reasons which stopped me in the past to writing. One was that my vocabulary was limited. I started my blogging actitivies back to 2004. At that time, my vocabulary was limited, I think the size of my vocabulary was in the range from 6000-7000 and most words were memorize in isolated way.</description>
