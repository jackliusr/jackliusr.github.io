      <description>Last week I worked on filling info package information to a workbooks. I used VBA macro before and thought of it again to save some of my time.
 Things is changing very fast, the new javascript based custom fuction is the mainstream. The initial one I followed the tutorial, however I didn’t find any way to add it into &amp;#34;My Addin&amp;#34; as described in microsoft doc site. I don’t have administrator rights on my laptop.</description>

      <description>Background I didn’t find a rule implementation of spectral at stoplightio and github to lint the rule that resources should be nouns in REST API. stoplight mentions that Use Nouns for Resource Names, however there is no another article about that. I was bothered by that for a while to the point I want to give it a try to implement my rule for that.
 There are several existing implementations about this rule.</description>

      <description>run redux-saga examples TL;DR:
 yarn yarn build
 I run into module not found issues when I try to run those examples under the repository of redus-saga. Even following comments in github issues and stackoverflow, those solutions don’t work out.
 Scripts in the package.json of the root folder don’t work for examples.
 After run yarn &amp;amp;&amp;amp; yarn build, can change directories to those examples and run them.</description>
