      <description>I chose logseq as my PKM I was overloaded with information in the past several weeks. I sought many ways to overcome it. One choice I made is using logseq as PKM.
   why? There are several open source or freeware verion of PKM. Why did I choose logseq?
   logseq is clojure based. I am a big fan of lisp-liked languages. I studied and did some coding using racket, common-lisp, elisp and clojure after I read Paul Grahamâ€™s essays about lisp.</description>
