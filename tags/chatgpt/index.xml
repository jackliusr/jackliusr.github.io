      <description>It is about three months now. I make reflections on things I have done well and bad. I will refine my learning workflow.
 In the past, I used 2nd-brain, daily-logging, flashcard and spaced-repetition systems to help to accelerate my learning under the circumstance that I can’t get fully complete information from different stake holders. I was left with only way to find it out by myself. I read all material I thought will be useful and noted them down in my logseq vault.</description>

      <description>How do you extract multiple fields at different levels of nesting json resources? jsonpath, jq, jmespath or chatgpt?
 In FHIR, bundle resource in json format usually have multiple level of details nested in json. It’s quite different from other use cases.
 My first thought is using jsonpath as it is quite similar to FHIRPath. There are several limitations of jsonpath which make it infeasible.
  It doesn’t support to the use case, even though JsonPath supports deep scan and Bracket-notated child or children.</description>

      <description>Background I didn’t find a rule implementation of spectral at stoplightio and github to lint the rule that resources should be nouns in REST API. stoplight mentions that Use Nouns for Resource Names, however there is no another article about that. I was bothered by that for a while to the point I want to give it a try to implement my rule for that.
 There are several existing implementations about this rule.</description>
