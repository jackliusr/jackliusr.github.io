      Last week I setup our staging kubernetes environment, however the once worked version of runnerset yaml configuration didn’t work. I tried different combination of controller and summerwind/actions-runner-dind image, fully customized template portion with RUNNER_xxx arguments. I still got &#34;Http response code: NotFound from &#39;POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration&#39;&#34; for every combination of those combinations in the logs of runner pods. I thought RunnerDeployment is stateless and less complex than RunnerSet. I gave it a try.

      Asynchronization is very hard. It brings benefits with several catches for backend programming. Here is serveral catches and respective solutions. However all those will increase the cost of developments.
   Hard to debug and trace As the process breaks down to serveral asynchronious subprocesses, it is very difficult to relate all information of the process when something goes wrong. An extra overhead correlation Id is needed to adopt to ameliorate this issue.

      TLDR: Bazel is definitely worth to use on your projects even though it has minimum supports of some languages such as C#.
   Prologue Before I was interested in bazel, I always thought why bother to learn a new building system even I knew that kubernetes once was built with bazel. 4 months ago, I was involved in a micro service structured project.

      Usually I don’t want to blog about something, espicially I don’t contribute some original things to internet. Of couse, there are other reasons as well.
 There were many reasons which stopped me in the past to writing. One was that my vocabulary was limited. I started my blogging actitivies back to 2004. At that time, my vocabulary was limited, I think the size of my vocabulary was in the range from 6000-7000 and most words were memorized in isolated way.

      Last week I setup our staging kubernetes environment, however the once worked version of runnerset yaml configuration didn’t work. I tried different combination of controller and summerwind/actions-runner-dind image, fully customized template portion with RUNNER_xxx arguments. I still got &#34;Http response code: NotFound from &#39;POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration&#39;&#34; for every combination of those combinations in the logs of runner pods. I thought RunnerDeployment is stateless and less complex than RunnerSet. I gave it a try.

      2 weeks I started to learn alicloud to prepare the migration from aws to alicloud. I started the migration this week. Our applications are deployed on kubernetes, I focused on ACK first. The setup journey was bumpy, and most of the issues can be resolved by googling and trial loops. The most difficult one is that dns resolution issue.
 I tried the steps in &#34;Debugging DNS Resolution&#34; [1]. All steps were good except the nslookup step.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I wrote my blogs using Jekyll at this domain almost two years occasionally from 2018 until 2020. I didn’t think to move to Hugo before it was used in one of my company project. After two or three weeks since the project kicked off, I had a thought why not move to Hugo considering several benefits.
 For the uninitiated, Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.

      I am a big fan of Tex and asciidoc. Asciidoctor is ruby based and can been easily integrated into jekyll. Hugo currently still has some rough edges in asciidoc integration. Considering the time and effort to switch to Hugo, it is not worth to do that.

      Today I encountered a strange issue with one kubernete cluster. Newly created pods are not created on a newly joined node. There is no errors in logs of pods and the node, events of kubernete. All seems normal. I created a simple nginx pod with nodeName as the problematic node. The pod can be scheduled and created in the node. However the pod was kept in CrashloopBackOff state. There is definitely something wrong with server.

      Dapr development is quite difficult to setup correctly. You can get the idea from (this issue) as the issue is still open now since it was created.
 I followed the instruction to install dapr vs code extension in dapr. My environment is WSL based. I tried several times to try to debug the dapr applications and failed. I noticed in the following screenshot that there was a warning icon before kubernetes.

The setup journey was bumpy, and most of the issues can be resolved by googling and trial loops. The most difficult one is that dns resolution issue.
 I tried the steps in &#34;Debugging DNS Resolution&#34; [1]. All steps were good except the nslookup step.

      During practicing the lifecycle handlers of pod, I found it is quite difficult to get the logs logged from preStop handlers. Initially I thought terminationMessagePath maybe is the answer, but no such luck. The preStop handler will be run before the pod is deleted. After deleted, there is no way to get the logs unless those logs are kept in other place such as central log servers etc. Those settings are way complex for a simple practice and time-consuming.

 There are two ways to do that in alibaba classic load balancer: http/https listeners, and TCP listeners with proxy protocol
 HTTPS listeners is crossed out due to certificate issue. HTTPS listeners can use integrated certificates or self uploaded certificates.

      During practicing the lifecycle handlers of pod, I found it is quite difficult to get the logs logged from preStop handlers. Initially I thought terminationMessagePath maybe is the answer, but no such luck. The preStop handler will be run before the pod is deleted. After deleted, there is no way to get the logs unless those logs are kept in other place such as central log servers etc. Those settings are way complex for a simple practice and time-consuming.

      I can’t debug the dockerdev app following the steps in https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2020/05/11/using-kubernetes-from-goland/, even after I cloned its source code https://github.com/jackliusr/dockerdev/tree/kubernetes-debug.
 I read several articles before I tried the aboved one. The successful debug after several trial and errors. I added skaffold.yaml to the project and installed Cloud Code. skaffold.yaml can be found at https://github.com/jackliusr/dockerdev/tree/kubernetes-debug.

          cloud code is a very good tool.

      Several months ago, I resolved the issue &#34;404 Error on refresh with SPA&#34; by using nginx try_files directive, this time it was quite different as the apps were deployed into kubernetes. I tried nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex:true and nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1. To avoid to block others to others to use staging environment, I setup an skaffold local development environment to troubeshooting the issue. I tried following annotation as well.
