      <description>Today I got certified as Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS). It marks a milestone in my mastery of kubernetes after a long journey. It is a good time to reflect on lessons what I learnt.
 My experiences with kubernetes from 2018. I have a habit of comparing other optiosn before making my decisions. Before 2018, I used vagrant and other configuration management tools (puppet, chef, ansible) to setup my lab environments.</description>

      <description>The fastest way to get nodes Many times, I run &amp;#34;kubectl get nodes&amp;#34; to get nodes I need to connect to make changes. In the question description section of tasks, master nodes and worker nodes are given. I think the fastest way to get nodes and I wasted some time on getting that info from commands.
   Get events Now kubectl has events command. The events command has intuitive options and less keystokes.</description>
