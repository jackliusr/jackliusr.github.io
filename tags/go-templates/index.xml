      <description>I wrote my blogs using Jekyll at this domain almost two years occasionally from 2018 until 2020. I didnâ€™t think to move to Hugo before it was used in one of my company project. After two or three weeks since the project kicked off, I had a thought why not move to Hugo considering several benefits.
 For the uninitiated, Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.</description>
