      <description>I started one of my certificates using cert-manager and letsencrypt without root domain in one product system. Later I tried to add root domain to the certificate as our customer requested withou success at first day. I figured out how to do that next morning. Here are my the success one and several failed attempts.
 Here some background information of this system: gitops + argocd
 Successful solution Considering that the app argocd is in manual synchronization mode, I can do that changes in place in kubernetes instead of the git repo.</description>
