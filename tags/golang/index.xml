      <description>Today I found my argo-events sensor executed triggers which I was not intended to. In the logs, I found that ref fields of those non-intended triggers all started with &amp;#34;refs/heads/dev&amp;#34;. I checked again with document and found this surprising truth:
 https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/sensors/filters/data/#:~:text=If%20data%20type%20is%20string%2C%20you%20can%20pass%20either%20an%20exact%20value%20or%20a%20regex.%20In%20any%20case%20that%20value%20will%20be%20evaluated%20as%20a%20regex.
 If data type is string, you can pass either an exact value or a regex. In any case that value will be evaluated as a regex.   Considing my following data filter, no wonder it triggers more than I expected.</description>
