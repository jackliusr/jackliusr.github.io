      <description>The real differences is quoted here. You can find the content here
 A kustomization that is marked as a Component has basically the same capabilities as a normal kustomization. The main distinction is that they are evaluated after the resources of the parent kustomization (overlay or component) have been accumulated, and on top of them. This means that: A component with transformers can transform the resources that an overlay has previously specified in the resources field.</description>
