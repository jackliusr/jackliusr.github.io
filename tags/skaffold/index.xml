      <description>TLDR: Bazel is definitely worth to use on your projects even though it has minimum supports of some languages such as C#.
   Prologue Before I was interested in bazel, I always thought why bother to learn a new building system even I knew that kubernetes once was built with bazel. 4 months ago, I was involved in a micro service structured project. I was dissatisfied with dev workflow using skaffold and I looked other options in the market.</description>

      <description>python-guestbook at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-code-samples is used to practice debug python containers in kubernetes.
 Google cloud python code vscode plugin 1.7.0 failed to run python on kubernetes or there is no obvious way to do that as depicted in the below pic.      Steps to make it:
  run
skaffold debug     Import ptvsd in the python file to debug, add breakout() before the line to debug</description>

      <description>I canâ€™t debug the dockerdev app following the steps in https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2020/05/11/using-kubernetes-from-goland/, even after I cloned its source code https://github.com/jackliusr/dockerdev/tree/kubernetes-debug.
 I read several articles before I tried the aboved one. The successful debug after several trial and errors. I added skaffold.yaml to the project and installed Cloud Code. skaffold.yaml can be found at https://github.com/jackliusr/dockerdev/tree/kubernetes-debug. Other jetbrain configuration can be seen in the below pictures.
          cloud code is a very good tool.</description>
