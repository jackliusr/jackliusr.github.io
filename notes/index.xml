      <description>In the past I learnt a lot of kubernetes, however there is no much information about kubelet or not deep enough. I couldn’t answer the questions about kubelet correctly in an interview. Here I put all the information I collected from the internet here for my references.

      <description>One of my past projects is based neural network in 2020. The solution is quite simple:
   put the feature vectors into postgresql database
  create distanced based index
   I adopted the model and algrithm from face_recognition, and my team trained on sample faces from our internal system to improve the accuracy to reduce the human involvement and save costs. During development, we found that there is a limit of postgres: CUBE_MAX_DIM, my team customize the build of postgreql to work around the limit.</description>
