== Prepare yourself
two most frequently experienced types of transitions: promotions and onboarding into new companies.


principles:

you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process

delegation: 

Influence Differently: “ Decision making becomes more political—less about authority, and more about influence.”


Communicate More Formally: “maintain regular, direct contact with select customers, for instance, or meet regularly with groups of frontline employees, all without undermining the integrity of the chain of command.”
