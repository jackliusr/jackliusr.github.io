=== avoid transition traps

* Sticking with what you know: the new role requires you to stop doing some things and to embrace new competencies.
* Falling prey to the “action imperative.”
* Setting unrealistic expectations.
* Attempting to do too much
* Coming in with “the” answer
* Engaging in the wrong type of learning
* Neglecting horizontal relationships

== Prepare yourself
two most frequently experienced types of transitions: promotions and onboarding into new companies.


=== Getting Promoted

Balance Breadth and Depth



Rethink What You Delegate

principles:

you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process

delegation: 

Influence Differently: “ Decision making becomes more political—less about authority, and more about influence.”


Communicate More Formally: “maintain regular, direct contact with select customers, for instance, or meet regularly with groups of frontline employees, all without undermining the integrity of the chain of command.”


Exhibit the Right Presence

core promotion challenges


=== Onboarding into a New Company

four pillars:

* business orientation
* stakeholder connection
* expectation alignment
* cultural adaption

=== prepare yourself

* established a clear breakpoint: get into the transition state of mind
* assess your vulnerabilities
* assessment of problem preference
* Preference for problems and functions
* watch out for your strengths
* relearn how to learn
* rework your network
* watch out for people who want to hold you back.
* get some help
