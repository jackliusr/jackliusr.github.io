Today I installed RabbitMQ 3.7.13-1. However I always got the following messages when running rabbitmq-server and a dump. The error message doesn't give any clue of root cause. It is none of the cases searched from google such as permission issue, configuration issue etc.

[source, javascript]
----
{"init terminating in do_boot",{undef,[{rabbit_prelaunch,start,[],[]},{init,start_em,1,[]},{init,do_boot,3,[]}]}} 
----

I re-read the installation guide and double-checked steps and configuration. There is no luck.  Reading the release notes from github, I noticed compatibility notes. That is the root cause. I changed erlang from 19.3 to erlang 21 and everything is okay now.
