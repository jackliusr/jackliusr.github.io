Measuring volume

* Many chemical reactions involve liquids, solutions or gases.
* some common apparatus used to measure the volume of a gas, a solution or a liquid in a chemical reactions.
* Gas: gas syringe, it is used to *collect gases of any density*.
* Liquid:

|pipette

* used to deliver an accurate fixed volume of a solution.
* There are different pipettes designed to deliver different fixed volumes of solutions, such as 20 cm^3^, 25 cm^3^ or 50cm^3^

* Meniscus is the *surface of the liquid that curves at the side* of the measuring intrument. To get an accurate volume reading, it must be read from the lowest or the highest level of the meniscus. *The surface of the liquid may curve upwards or downwards depending on the type of liquids*.



== Collection of Gases

=== Methods for collecting gases

Gases can be collected by the following methods

* Displacement of air
* Displacement of water
* Gas syringes

====  Displacement of air

* Used to collect gases of *densities higher or lower than air*. it is not suitable for collecting a gas with a density same as air.
* The air in a test tube will be displaced by the gas to be collected.
* Two type of displacement of air
** Downward delivery
** Upward delivery

==== Downward delivery
* used to collect a gas which is *more dense than air*
+

[cols="2*" options="header"]
|===
| Example |  Chemical formula
| Chlorine | Cl~2~
| hydrogen chloride | HCl
| sulfur dioxide | SO~2~
| carbon dioxide | CO~2~
| nitrogen dioxide | NO~2~

|===

* The test tube or collecting apparatus is placed at the *upright* position. The gas produced *sinks down* into a test tube and displaces the air inside it.


==== Upward delivery
* Used to collect a gas which is *less dense than air*.
+

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Example | Chemical Formula
| hydrogen | H~2~
| ammonia | NH~3~
|===

* The test tube or collecting apparatus is placed at an *inverted* position. The gas produced *rises up* into a test tube and displaces the air inside it.

==== Displacement of water
Suitable for gases:

*  *Insoluble* or only *slightly soluble in water*
* Has the *density almost the same as air*(displacement of air can't take place)
+

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
| Example         |  Chemical Formula | Reason for collecting gas using displacement of air
| hydrogen        | H~2~              | slighted soluble in water only.
| oxygen          | O~2~       | has the same density of air,  can't displace air from a collecting tube.
| carbon dioxide | CO~2~    | slightly soluble in water only
|===

==== Drying Agents

Drying agent can be used to obtain a dry sample of gas by removing its moisture content.

The three common drying agents used in the laboratory to gases:

| Chemical Name | Chemical formula | Examples of gases
| anhydrous calcium chloride | CaCl~2~  | all gases except ammonia(NH~3~)
| concentrated sulfuric acid | H~2~SO~4~ | all gases except alkaline gas such as ammonia ( NH~2~)
| Calcium oxide | CaO   | all gases except acidic gases such as sulfur dioxide ( SO~2~)

== Elements, Compounds and Mixtures

=== Elements
* All elements which are composed of only *one type of atom* are called an element.
* Elements are the building blocks of matter because the elements alone or in combinations make up the entire universe such as the Sun, the Earth and all living and non-living things.

| Others | 9.2 | Others | 2.2
|===

* 117 known elements. About 92 of them occur naturally on Earth.
* Elements are pure substances that *cann't be broken down into any simpler substances* by chemical methods.
* In nature, elements can exist as
**  Single atoms called monatomic elements.
**  *Moecules of elements* which are pure substances made up of two or more atoms of the same type chemically joined together.
* In chemistry, atoms in an element can be represented by colour or size. The diagramatic representation of elements.

| Ozone | O~3~ |   | Molecule of an element
| Sulfur | S~8~ |  | Molecule of an element
|===

* Each element has its own unique physical properties. Hence, we can use the following properties to identify an element:
** Melting point
** Boiling point
* Element can be classified as metals and non-metals

=== Compound

A compound is a substance that contains two or more elements that are chemically combined. The elements in a compound are present in fixed proportions. 

A chemical formula can be used to represent a compound. The formula shows:

* the symbols for each element in the compound
* the number of atoms of each element in a unit of the compound
* Examples of compounds and their formulae.
