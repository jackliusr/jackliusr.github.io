= Issues of clean setup spacemacs and their solutions



I encountered the same issue "File error: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, bind-map" twice in my setup of spacemacs. The issue can be solved several ways which I found from github and clojurians-log.clojureverse.org. I consolidate the reasons and list them below. 

* Timeout: the relevant setting in .spacemacs :- dotspacemacs-elpa-timeout 30
* TLS Certs: emacs --insecure
* Permanent TLS Certs: the relevant setting in .spacemacs, dotspacemacs-elpa-https  nil
* Proxy: 
+
[source,lisp]

(setq
 url-proxy-services ;; TODO use (getenv "proxy")
 ;; must NOT contain "http://", "https://"
 '(("http"     . "<proxy-machine>:<port>")
   ("https"    . "<proxy-machine>:<port>")))
----
* incorrect permissions of ~/.emacs.d:

[source, bash]
----
chown -R ~/.emacs.d
