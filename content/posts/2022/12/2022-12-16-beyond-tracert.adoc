I wondered why I was asked twice about network troubleshooting between two machines and the destination machine is not reachable directly. It seems there are somethings I didn't understand fully or I missed something. 


Today I googled "tracert is not enough" and found https://www.netbraintech.com/blog/limitations-of-traceroute/[Traceroute Limitations Explained]. It explains my doubts now. 

https://www.netbraintech.com/blog/limitations-of-traceroute/[Traceroute Limitations Explained] gives some limitations of traceroute and introduce their production to avoid those limitations. Are there any other ways? 

I have some experiences using wireshark and tcpdump, and learnt some thing about VPC Flow Logs as in aws.  I think they can been used when traceroute is not enough in some settings.
