In normal kubernetes metrics, you will find cAdvisor, Metrics Server, Kubernetes API Server, Node Exporter, and Kube-State-Metrics as source of metrics. In last 2 days, I noticed prometheus-adapter. Today KEDA popped up in my mind. I checked its website and found it can be source of metric as well. 


cAdvisor, Metrics Server, Kubernetes API Server, Node Exporter, and Kube-State-Metrics can be considered as in-cluster source of metric.  However KEDA is about out-cluster source of metrics.


KEDA metric server: 
  export metrics of scaled objects.

KEDA scaler: feed custom metrics based on external event sources


What's about prometheus-adapter?

It can also replace the metrics server on clusters that already run Prometheus and collect the appropriate metrics.

How to replace metric-server with prometheus-adapter?

Here I noted down questions and things I found interesting. I will learn and writing those later.
