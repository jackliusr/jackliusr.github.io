== Prologue
I never thought I will use nginx extensively in systems I involved after I found that nginx ingress has some limitations comparing to istio in 2021. Nginx is more than reverse proxy or webservers which I thought initially after several months of extensive usage in the past. Here I list serveral advanced use case I countered or discussed with other experts.
