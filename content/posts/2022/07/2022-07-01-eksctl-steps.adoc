I only noticed the steps after one ergent cancelling of creating.  I didn't find corresponding nodes and wondered what happened. I deleted my cluster and recreated one. 

I knew I can create nodegroup after creating cluster and not sure if I can do those sub tasks this way as well.  Leave it here for later investigation.

2 sequential tasks: { create cluster control plane "uat-local-intl",
    2 sequential sub-tasks: {
        4 sequential sub-tasks: {
            wait for control plane to become ready,
            associate IAM OIDC provider,
            4 parallel sub-tasks: {
                2 sequential sub-tasks: {
                    create IAM role for serviceaccount "backend-apps/s3-reader",
                    create serviceaccount "backend-apps/s3-reader",
                },
                2 sequential sub-tasks: {
                    create IAM role for serviceaccount "backend-apps/cache-access",
                    create serviceaccount "backend-apps/cache-access",
                },
                2 sequential sub-tasks: {
                    create IAM role for serviceaccount "kube-system/cluster-autoscaler",
                    create serviceaccount "kube-system/cluster-autoscaler",
                },
                2 sequential sub-tasks: {
                    create IAM role for serviceaccount "kube-system/aws-node",
                    create serviceaccount "kube-system/aws-node",
                },
            },
            restart daemonset "kube-system/aws-node",
        },
        create nodegroup "ng-1",
    }
}
