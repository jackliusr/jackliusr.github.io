ChatOps has its place, even more prominent with AI and rich integration with other systems.

I learnt ChatOps in the past when I first heard hubot. Later GitOps and Kubernetes grabbed my attention. I didn't see how ChatOps fit in GitOps until I saw this https://wanqu.co/b/7/%E6%B9%BE%E5%8C%BA%E6%97%A5%E6%8A%A5%E6%98%AF%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E8%BF%90%E4%BD%9C%E7%9A%84/[湾区日报是如何运作的？] today after I implemented an integration with telegram bot APIs.

https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/benefits-of-chatops[What Are the Benefits of ChatOps?] enumerates the benefits. In my eyes I saw other benefits or more benefits in productivity when considing the full potentials of ChatOps.

IM is ubuquitious, everyone is familiar with that. With well integration with other applications in other ways such as https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps[webapp], bots, miniapps, plus conversation AI, the whole experience will bring to another level. There will be no switch-back-and-forth to complete a jobs. The work stream feeds are in the conversation. Those can make one easily into the https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202[flow mode]. There will be great potentilas in this area.


Considering another case, AI based assisants such as apple siri, google assistant, amazon Alexa, and microsoft Cortana, this will go the highest level, using most natural way of communication-voice. 

The relation between ChatOps and GitOps is not clear-cut. ChatOps  has some overlaps with GitOps about Ops side. There are bidirectional relation between the two. For example ChatOps can initiate a GitOps process and GitOps can initiate a ChatOps process as well.

ChatOps bring more user interaction related tasks into the picture: human workflow task which are neccessary in certain circumstances.
