When I tried to create an user for application instead of giving out the master user and its password. I got "Error Code: 1045. Access denied for user 'mysqladmin'@'%' (using password: YES)" when I run "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON demodb.* TO 'appadmin'@'%';". 

I tried the method in https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/duplicate-master-user-mysql/[How do I create another master user for my Amazon RDS DB instance that is running MySQL?], it is for creating another master user with more permissions than an app db user.


Several discussions in stackoverflow don't give me the appropriate list of permissions. Here is my list of permissions for this case. 

[source, sql]
----
CREATE USER 'mysqladmin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'aaabbbccc';
GRANT CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, CREATE VIEW, EVENT, TRIGGER, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, EXECUTE ON demodb.* 
TO 'mysqladmin'@'%' ;
flush privileges;
