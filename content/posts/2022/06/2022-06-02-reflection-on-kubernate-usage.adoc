Today I explained the current infrastructure fleet configurations to our devops team, I have the thought to make a reflection on the things or lessons I learnt in the past and think about what should I do in the next.

The technologies and tools I used in my projects is as following. There are still a lot of things to learn considering the list in my https://github.com/jackliusr/k8s[list] and the huge ecosystem of kubernetes. 

* kubernetes
* kubectl
* kustomize
* cert-manager
* argo-cd
* istio
* godaddy-webhook
* eksctl
* elk(filebeat, elasticsearch, kibinan)
* metrics-server
* sealed-secrets
* action-runner
* helm
* argo-workflow
* argo-events
* jsonpatch
* jsonpath
* jq
* yq
* letsencrypt 
* ACME (HTTP01, DNS1)
* dapr
