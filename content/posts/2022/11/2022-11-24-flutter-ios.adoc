Last three days, I found an issue can only be reproduced in realease mode.The beta testing cycle via testflight takes too long and it definitely is not the option. I debugged my application in iOS before. One thing popped up in my mind whether I can put release mode of my application into iOS using the debug tool of vs code.

I changed my launch.json as below in my project and debug my application. My application in release mode can be installed in iOS now.

    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Flutter (iPhone jack)",
            "program": "lib/main.dart",
            "deviceId": "00008030-001C61C23C430000",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "args": [
                "--release"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

After that, the issue can be reproduced. It surprised me really. There are two other options Enterprise and Ad Hoc to do release build distribution. I am not sure which options this is. I will check it later and write something about it.
