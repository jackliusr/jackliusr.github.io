Today I re-read https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2022/03/tr_technology_radar_vol_26_en.pdf[Technology Radar Volume 26], SDUI got my attention. In the past, I was very interested in ERP systems, and studied several open source ERP systems such as openerp(now odoo), ofbiz and adempiere.  SDUI is quite similar to technologies used in those open sourced ERP systems.
