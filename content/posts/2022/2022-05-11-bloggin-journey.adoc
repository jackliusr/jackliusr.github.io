Usually I don't want to blog about something, espicially I don't contribute some original things to internet. Of couse, there are other reasons as well.

There were many reasons which stopped me in the past to writing. One was that my vocabulary was limited. I started my blogging actitivies back to https://jackliusr.blogspot.com/2004/[2004]. At that time, my vocabulary was limited, I think the size of my vocabulary was in the range from 6000-7000 and most words were memorized in isolated way. I didn't know how to express my thought in the proper way and I shied away from writing those simple blogs. You can find my old blogs at https://jackliusr.blogspot.com[here].

Thinking back, I missed many benefits of writing  when I didn't keep writing. 

I started to use https://apps.ankiweb.net/[anki] to memorize vocabulary from Jan 2016. Since then, I basically use anki daily and until recently I started to hava a feeling that I can write something better than before and started to write again. The real reason, I think the blogging can be anchors for later recall. 

Even though, I don't write daily, I wrote more frequent than before. I will do it more in the future.
