I wrote my blogs using Jekyll at this https://jackliusr.github.io[domain] almost two years occasionally from 2018 until 2020. I didn't think to move to Hugo before it was used in one of my company project. After two or three weeks since the project kicked off, I had a thought why not move to Hugo considering several benefits. 

For the uninitiated, Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.  The most important part is that it is based on Go Templates which is used as filter language in https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect/#extended-description[docker], https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/list-all-running-container-images/#list-container-images-using-a-go-template-instead-of-jsonpath[kubectl] and script language of https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/functions_and_pipelines/[helm]. I used kubernetes for one year in my job, and I knew the usage of go-templates in docker,kubectl and helm. I thought that was the click moment to kill two birds with one stone. 

I spent one day to migrate https://github.com/jackliusr/old_jackliusr.github.io[my old blog] from Jekyll to Hugo and one day to figure how to integrate with plantuml. After all, I got a faster blog generator. Most of all, I got familiar with go-templates. I used it since then in daily usage when I worked with kubectl, docker, helm. Recently I even used go-templates in https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/[argo-workflows], https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[argo-cd] and https://tekton.dev/[tekton]. 


Today, two years have passed. I felt I was fortunate to make that decision at that time and got the benefits in the long run. I do recommend to migrate to hugo if you are in the similar situation like me.
