There are 27 issues with podfile dependency issues of google_mobile_ads in its repository googleads-mobile-flutter at github 
https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/search?q=Firebase%2FAnalytics&type=issues[Here you can find those issues]. My team encountered this issue in the past weeks. Today I had the issue again. To save my time in future, I kept my approach here this time. 

. Use the following search keywords in cs.github.com
+
....
path:pubspec.yaml google_mobile_ads firebase_analytics
....
. locate a good candidate with appropriate version of combinations of the following components., or just change versions of some components to lower versions
+
....
firebase_core
firebase_analytics
google_mobile_ads
....
. flutter pub get
. build
