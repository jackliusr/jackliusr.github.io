In the last week, I intermittently worked on how to compile a flutter project conditionally like the way c/c++ in busy daily work schedules. I knew that flavor is https://dev.to/deskangel/how-flutter-does-conditional-compilation-5a5m[the way] to go, however there are still serveral issues opened to explore to make it better or to understand the rationale behind the scene. 


* Dependency Injections using get_it and injectable: https://github.com/Milad-Akarie/injectable/issues/181[Tree Shaking Capability]
* Pack only neccessary components into the mobile app: 
** flutter pub remove/add packages: without this, some platform code of components maybe will be included in the final artifact.
** flavored dependencies in build.gradle
** dart entry files with mimifization enabled.
* Design pattern( factory, template methods etc)
* iOS: scheme, main entry point file
* android: different activity or just flavored mainactivity?
* sourceSets or just default flavor folders?
* dynamic dispatch or type check??

I left those issues here in case of I forget them, I will revisit them later
