I am passionate about technological details and how things work under the hood. Recently I didn't get confirmative answers from AWS. I spent a half day to re-read the famous https://www.amazon.science/publications/dynamo-amazons-highly-available-key-value-store[paper]. and the new one https://www.amazon.science/publications/amazon-dynamodb-a-scalable-predictably-performant-and-fully-managed-nosql-database-service[Amazon DynamoDB: A Scalable, Predictably Performant, and Fully Managed NoSQL Database Service]. I think the following several concepts can be helpful to under its predictable performance.


== Consistent Hashing  and zero hop DHT

I always put all of the three pictures into a slides and put refereneres at the last slides.
