I shared one of CICD I designed and implemented in linkedin. It is good to keep here as well. I researched several options and put my thought at https://jackliusr.github.io/posts/2022/06/reflection-on-my-choice-of-cicd-in-the-past/[Reflection on implementation of CICD using argo-workflows]

Nowadays, argo-workflows is quite mature. I will use argo-workflows for CI part in my future projects. It is definitely worth to invest one's time on argo-workflow as it is widely used.
