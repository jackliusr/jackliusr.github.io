I used mindmap in my logseq, however it show left to right side, the start node is always at the left side. I prefer to have the main concept shown in the center. Jsmind is the perfect fit after I saw its demos. Here is I create a shortcode in my hugo and try to create a demo mindmap using jsmind. 

{{< jsmind >}}
