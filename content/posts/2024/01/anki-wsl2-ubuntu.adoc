I daily use anki to review things. However I have issues to run it in wsl2+ubuntu 22.04 environment. The only solution for me is below. 

The workable version is 2.1.66  Qt5 with the following environment variable

[source,bash]
----
export QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS="--disable-seccomp-filter-sandbox"
