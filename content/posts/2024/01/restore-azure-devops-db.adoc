I spent almost a whole afternoon today to restore a project collections . It doesn't go well. Azure devops server might supports SQL Server express version. and I choose the wrong way to do that. After several trial, I figure out the way to restore a project collections of azure devops to another instance. The steps is as following. 

. install sql server (not sure if sql server express is compatible)
. restore the backup (bak, trn, log) of the database of a project collections
. install azure devops server with basic and new database
. attach a project collection as depicted in below image
