I used dotpeek for a while to decompile dotnet assembly. Only 
yesterday I finally found a way to export project from dotnet assembly. The picture below is the menu to do that in dotpeek. However the version I used doesn't perfectly decompile lambda expression. The decompiled code of lambda expressions are very hard to understand.

Ilspy is one of  decompiler that can decompile lambda in a understandble way.
