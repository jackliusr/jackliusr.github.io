Last week I was assigned a task to keep search result pages of a site of my company up to date. After researching, trial and errors, I found out the following ways to keep the search result pages in search engines up to date.

* Remove outdated content from search result of google and Bing.
** temporary: block URLs from webmaster tools
** permanent: 
... get sitemaps.xml of old site and clean up thoroughly.
... add noindex to outdated pages and robots.txt.
* Add new contents to search result of google and Bing.
** temporary: submit individual important URLs to google and Bing.
** permanent: get sitemap.xml of new site and submit sitemap.xml to google and Bing.
* check indexing status in search console/webmaster tools to make sure pages indexed.
* check too many redirections: crawl sites and try to find too many redirections.
* Improvement:   speed up indexing, may incur costs for indexing when crawling beyond crawl budget from google and Bing.
** to add indexnow for Bing,
** add indexing Api for google search.
* google/Bing search alerts for outdated content: checking interval 90 days.
