Long ago, I wanted to learn something about technology leaderships, however I didn't know how to do it.  One or two months ago I found Will Larson's book https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186["An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management"] which recommended by others and today I found another books https://waydev.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Books-for-Leaders-in-Tech_-the-Waydev-Selection_compressed.pdf[Best Books for Leaders in Tech: theWaydev Selection]. It's time to put the ideas into action since I already completed a big milestone of learning English. As one of my new year resolutions, I will read all the books in the https://waydev.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Books-for-Leaders-in-Tech_-the-Waydev-Selection_compressed.pdf[Best Books for Leaders in Tech: theWaydev Selection] and practice them.
