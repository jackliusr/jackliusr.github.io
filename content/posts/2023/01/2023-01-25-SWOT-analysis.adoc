Once I read an article about how to apply SWOT Analysis for personal career and strategies to in career development.  The article  most likely  is https://www.mindtools.com/aaiakpy/personal-swot-analysis[Personal SWOT Analysis] as I read a lot of articles from mindtools.com. 


When I read the article, I also found several strategies how to convert my weakness to strengths. I finally converted one of my weakness -- English to one of my strengths in the past 5 years by keeping learning and practicing English. Now I can get my idea across easily.

Today I should do the analysis for my future improvement.
