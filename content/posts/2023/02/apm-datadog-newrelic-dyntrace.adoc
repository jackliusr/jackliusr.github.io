Last week and this week, I completed my basic learning of APMs as a tool of SRE. I learnt fundamentals of datadog and newrelic, walked through their tutorials in last week and this week. I don't find a easy way to learn dynatrace from its site.
The whole learning experiences between datadog and newrelic are on par with each other. What's the deal breaker when making choices among them?

== Feature flags intergration

During a discussion about progressive delivery using https://flagger.app/[flagger], I was curious if it is possible to integrate feature flags and APM. In the past two days, I learnt that dynatrace supports it and dynatrace is actively involved in openfeature. However I found that newrelic give example on https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/correlate-feature-flags-with-application-metrics[how to integrate feature flags solutions].
