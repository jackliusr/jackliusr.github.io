Say in a situtation where budget is fixed, what will you do to improve system performance?

I came out several solutions to this at first, later I came out with more thoughts. I list them here for later reference.

. create selective indexes
. partition tables 
. materialized view
. asynchrous processing: put non real-time operations as a job queue, spread jobs to non business hours, non peak loading time etc.
. externalize reports: reports are stored as soft copies to avoid queries to historical data
. running totals: calculating running totals in real time, spread the calculation to many places. 
. archive and purge historical data.
. convert dynamic contents to static ones
. managed services changed based on usages
. optimize hotpathes in code
