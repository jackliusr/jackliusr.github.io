After thrice attempts, I finally successfully completed the task Selinux Installation at https://engineer.kodekloud.com/practice.   Since it is not straightforward, I posted here.

[source, shell-session]
----

> sudo yum install -y selinux*

> # SELINUX=disabled
> # change SELINUX in /etc/selinux/config 

> cat /etc/selinux/config | grep SELINUX
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
SELINUX=disabled
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of three values:
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
