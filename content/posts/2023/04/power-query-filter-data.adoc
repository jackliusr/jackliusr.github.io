2 days ago, I didn't figure out how to filter out data using power-query. I used a workaround solution to achive the same goal. Yesteray I occasionally found that I can filter out data directly without using my workaround solutions. 

- Table.SelectRows
+
```M
Table.SelectRows(
    Table.FromRecords({
        [CustomerID = 1, Name = "Bob", Phone = "123-4567"],
        [CustomerID = 2, Name = "Jim", Phone = "987-6543"],
        [CustomerID = 3, Name = "Paul", Phone = "543-7890"],
        [CustomerID = 4, Name = "Ringo", Phone = "232-1550"]
    }),
    each ( [CustomerID] > 2 and Text.Contains([Phone],"0") )
)
```
- Add a conditional column and filter on the column
