I never thought I will learn to use powershell seriously. Now I joined NTUC, there are many restrictions. Today I started to use linux utils equivalent in powershell.

- dig: Resolve-DnsName
- telnet: Test-NetConnection
- host: Get-Host 
- touch: New-Item
- cat: Get-Content
- tail: Get-Content
- grep: Where-Object or Select-String
- man: Get-Help
