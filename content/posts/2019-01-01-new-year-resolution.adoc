= Why I start to write again


I read a lot of blogs. However I rarely wrote my blogs about my thoughts and learning experiences as I thought those are lack of originality.


I changed my mind after I learned more than ten thousand words using anki and memrise in the past 2 years. A writing can serve multiple purposes even lack of originality and thorough thought. Here is a list of those purposes:   

* Deepen my understanding in the topics and improve efficiency of learning
* Improve my writing of English
* Be aware of my progress and boost confidence
* The writings are as anchors for later review

For those benefits, I should to start to write again. This will be the 2019 new year's resolution.


One bonus point, I will use asciidoc, jekyll and spacemacs to write. Kill two birds with one stone.
