Today one of my deployments always got CrashLoopBackOff. Searching internet don't gave me the root cause of those errors even I went through all the steps. Steps from internets are all about describe, logs, liveProbe etc. I noticed the reason and exit code in last state when I described one of the pod.  It should be the focus point to find root cause of CrashBoopBackOff.
